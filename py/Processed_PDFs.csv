procedures-300-appendix-b_1_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 300.APPENDIX B – THE ALLEGATIONS SYSTEM a) Purpose of the Allegation System The allegations identify and define specific types of moderate to severe harm, provide a framework for decision-making by SCR and investigative staff, and provide an important investigation tracking and record-keeping function. To fulfill the purposes of the allegation-based system, it is essential that the allegations are narrowly defined and used consistently throughout the state. The Child Protection Specialist must refer to the specific allegation and the factors endemic to that allegation, to guide him/her in making a final finding. Note: If investigative activities reveal an additional allegation is needed or a more appropriate allegation is needed to replace the allegation originally assigned, the Child Protection Specialist should identify and assign the most appropriate allegation. b) Allegations The allegation system defines moderate to severe harm or the risk of moderate to severe harm of a child. Many of the allegations are categorized as either abuse or neglect. All abuse allegations of harm are coded with a one or two-digit number, 40 and under. All neglect allegations of harm are coded with a two-digit number greater than 50. The allegations of harm are categorized and coded as follows: ABUSE NEGLECT #1 Death #51 Death #2 Head Injuries #52 Head Injuries #4 Internal Injuries #54 Internal Injuries #5 Burns #55 Burns #6 Poison/Noxious Substances #56 Poison/Noxious Substances #7 Wounds #57 Wounds #9 Bone Fractures #59 Bone Fractures #10 Substantial Risk of Physical #60 Substantial Risk of Physical Injury/Environment Injurious to Injury/Environment Injurious to Health and Welfare Health and Welfare #11 Cuts, Bruises, Welts, Abrasions and #61 Cuts, Bruises, Welts, Abrasions Oral Injuries and Oral Injuries #12 Human Bites #62 Human Bites Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",413,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-b.pdf

procedures-300-appendix-b_5_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 RELATIONSHIP ABUSE NEGLECT Other Persons X X Any other person responsible for the child’s welfare at the time of the alleged abuse or neglect. Included in this category are health care professionals, educational personnel, recreational supervisors, and volunteers or support personnel in any setting where children may be subject to abuse or neglect. Note: In accordance with ANCRA, an immediate family member, other person residing in the same home as the child or the parent's paramour cannot be alleged as the perpetrator of child neglect unless they were acting as the child's caretaker when the incident occurred. d) Reasonable Effort to Protect a Child ANCRA includes in its definition of abuse, persons who “allow[] to be inflicted upon such child physical injury, by other than accidental means.” 325 ILCS 5/3. If a parent, caregiver, immediate family member, other person residing in the home, or the parent’s paramour fails to make reasonable effort to protect a child from physical injury caused by other than accidental means, he/she can be an alleged perpetrator of abuse, rather than neglect. “Reasonable effort” refers to the effort a person responsible for the welfare of a child should be expected to make in order to protect a child, without posing an imminent threat to his or her safety. Note: Minors are not expected to intervene between an adult and another child. e) Harm or Imminent Risk of Harm Caused by the Blatant Disregard of Parental or Caregiver Responsibilities 1) ""Blatant disregard"" means an incident where the real, significant, and imminent risk of harm would be so obvious to a reasonable parent or caretaker that it is unlikely that a reasonable parent or caretaker would have exposed the child to the danger without exercising precautionary measures to protect the child from harm. [325 ILCS 5/3] Example: A home daycare provider, with a pool or pond on their property, who fails to provide adequate supervision or take necessary precautions to prevent a child from drowning. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",441,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-b.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-b_6_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 2) Allegations #74-85 are neglect allegations. All other allegations can be either abuse or neglect depending on the facts and circumstances. A child may sustain moderate to severe harm (e.g., brain damage, death, etc.) because of the ""blatant disregard"" of the parent or caregiver in his or her responsibility to oversee and protect the child. In such instances, the harm is the same to the child, however the cause is attributable to neglect, not abuse. f) Special Assessments in Cases of Egregious Acts 1) The Department has identified certain acts of maltreatment deemed egregious that require a special assessment by the Office of Legal Services (OLS) and the Division of Clinical Practice and Professional Development (Clinical). This special assessment will determine the need to by-pass reunification, seek a permanency goal other than reunification, and/or seek expedited termination of parental rights. If information identifying an egregious act is gathered at the time of the intake by SCR or during the course of the investigation, the report must be flagged as an egregious act case to alert the Child Protection Specialist and the Child Protection Supervisor that the case must be referred to OLS and Clinical. Maltreatment is considered egregious if it is an egregious, sadistic, or torturous act that inflicts significant pain, causes extensive external and/or internal bruising, serious injury, or death. 2) Egregious acts include but are not limited to: A) Perpetrator repeatedly threw or slammed an infant or toddler against a hard surface using a strong degree of force creating a likelihood of abusive head trauma or multiple injuries including bruising or fractures over time. B) Perpetrator caused abusive abdominal injuries, especially in very young children. C) Perpetrator submerged and held a child’s head under water or repeatedly submerged a child’s head creating a significant real or imminent risk of harm. D) Perpetrator beat up or hit a child with an object using a degree of force that could be reasonably expected to cause serious injury or death. E) Perpetrator attempted to or actually smothered, choked, strangled, or applied any other severe thoracic compression to a child. F) Perpetrator extensively burned or scalded a child on purpose.

H) Perpetrator took a child hostage. I) Sadistic injury to a child. J) Homicide of a child. K) Non-accidental poisoning. g) Outline of an Allegation 1) While each allegation contained in this section is unique and identifies specific contacts, activities, factors to be considered, and documentation that must be applied and performed when investigating that specific allegation, there are certain contact, activities, and documentation the Child Protection Specialist must apply and perform for ALL allegations. These functions are listed below. A requirement of every investigation is that the Child Protection Specialist gather and consider all inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. 2) THE CHILD PROTECTION SPECIALIST AND SUPERVISOR MUST REVIEW EACH ALLEGATION TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OR INSTRUCTIONS FOR A SPECIFIC ALLEGATION. Example: As a part of the initial contact with an alleged victim, the Child Protection Specialist is instructed to complete an assessment that includes photographs and a body chart for any injury or harm the alleged victim may have. A Child Protection Specialist must NEVER photograph an alleged victim of sexual abuse. The instructions for observing and assessing an alleged child abuse victim are contained within those specific allegations. 3) The requirements and guidelines for completing investigations are outlined below.

procedures-300-appendix-b_19_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 Some of the allegations below contain suggested questions that the Child Protection Specialist should ask during the course of the investigation. The suggested questions are part of the information gathering for the investigation. The Child Protection Specialist is still required to gather and consider all inculpatory and exculpatory evidence prior to making a final finding. Allegation of Harm #1/51 DEATH a) Definition Death: the permanent cessation of all vital functions. The following definitions of death are also commonly used: 1) Total irreversible cessation of cerebral function, spontaneous function of the respiratory system, and spontaneous function of the circulatory system; and 2) The final and irreversible cessation of perceptible heartbeat and respiration. b) Taking a Report 1) The reporter/source has reason to believe that the child’s death resulted from the following: i) A direct action of the parent, caregiver, immediate family member, other person residing in the home, the parent’s paramour, or other person responsible for the child’s welfare (ABUSE); ii) The failure of the parent, caregiver, immediate family member, other person residing in the home, the parent’s paramour, or other person responsible for the child’s welfare to make reasonable efforts to stop an action by another person that resulted in the child’s death (ABUSE); or iii) Blatant disregard of parental/caregiver responsibilities that resulted in the child’s death (NEGLECT). “Blatant disregard” means an incident where the real, significant, and imminent risk of harm would be so obvious to a reasonable parent or caretaker that it is unlikely that a reasonable parent or caretaker would have exposed the child to the danger without exercising precautionary measures to protect the child from harm. 325 ILCS 5/3. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 300.Appendix B",396,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-b.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-b_20_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 2) When taking a report involving the death of a child, allegations #10 Substantial Risk of Physical Injury or #60 Environment Injurious are applicable only to surviving siblings or other children residing in the home and shall not be assigned to the deceased child. c) Investigating a Report 1) Required Contacts All contacts and attempted contacts must be documented in a contact note within 48 hours. A) Conduct immediate individual and in-person interviews with surviving siblings and other children that lived or were temporarily staying in the environment in which the child died. Complete a safety assessment (CERAP) within 24 hours. Interviews should be conducted using the Forensic Interview protocol. Non-verbal children must be thoroughly observed and assessed. If there are additional children in the home that were not listed on the report, they must be added to the report, assigned an allegation as necessary, and their safety and trauma/grief therapy needs must be assessed. The Child Protection Specialist shall evaluate the need for grief therapy for all family members. Note: A child death, in and of itself, may not require removal of surviving children from the home. Note: If other children in the home are considered to be at risk, they should be asked if he/she knows an extended family member, another adult or caretaker that he or she feels safe with or important or special to. Persons identified by the other children in the home shall be interviewed. B) Notify and interview the alleged child victim’s primary medical provider as well as any other medical providers that have treated the alleged child victim within the past twelve (12) months. If multiple medical providers are identified, the Child Protection Specialist shall share all information provided with the Primary Care Physician.

After obtaining the autopsy report, scene investigation, any relevant laboratory test results, and a coroner’s inquest report if an inquest was conducted, a subsequent interview of the coroner/medical examiner should be conducted, if necessary, to understand the findings. D) A waiver of any of the above requirements must be approved by the Child Protection Supervisor and may require approval by the Area Administrator. Details of the request and the Supervisor’s decision must be documented in a supervisory note. 2) Required Activities All investigative activities must be documented in a contact or case note within 48 hours. In areas served by a Child Advocacy Center, investigations must be coordinated with the center if the center is willing to work with this allegation. A) Determine if a scene investigation has been completed. The coroner/medical examiner has primary responsibility to conduct the scene investigation. When the coroner/medical examiner and law enforcement have not already done so, conduct a scene investigation per Procedures 300.60, Scene Investigation. B) Medical examinations of all other children residing full or part-time in the home where the alleged child victim died are required. These medical exams may not be waived. See Procedures 300.100, Medical Requirements for Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect, for further instruction. C) Obtain reports completed by the attending physician, coroner/medical examiner regarding the cause and manner of the child’s death including autopsy report, scene investigation, any relevant laboratory test results, and coroner’s inquest report, if an inquest was conducted. Include medical records of surviving children, if potentially relevant to the final determination. D) Child Protection Specialists, in consultation with the Child Protection Supervisor, must complete a safety assessment of all other children living or temporarily staying in the environment where the child died.

G) A waiver of any of the above requirements must be approved by the Child Protection Supervisor and may require approval by the Area Administrator. Details of the request and the Supervisor’s decision must be documented in a supervisory note. 4) Assessment of Factors and Evidence to Determine a Final Finding A) Factors include: i) Did the child’s death result from: a) A direct action of the parent, caregiver, immediate family member, other person residing in the home, the parent’s paramour, or other person responsible for the child’s welfare? or b) The failure of the parent, caregiver, immediate family member, other person residing in the home, the parent’s paramour, or other person responsible for the child’s welfare to make reasonable efforts to stop an action by another person that resulted in the child’s death? ii) Did the parent or caregiver exhibit ‘blatant disregard’? B) A current report involving the same subjects of an unfounded report shall not be indicated solely on the basis of the prior unfounded report. If new details provide information that could impact a previously unfounded investigation, the information must be reported to the SCR to determine if a new investigation of the unfounded allegation is warranted. C) When making a final finding determination for Allegation #1/#51 Death, Allegations #10 Substantial Risk of Physical Injury, or #60 Environment Injurious may be applicable to surviving siblings or other children residing in the home but shall not be assigned to the deceased child. D) Coroners/Medical Examiners are limited to 5 manners of death: i) Homicide; ii) Suicide; iii) Natural; iv) Undetermined, and v) Accidental Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 300.Appendix B",419,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-b.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-b_24_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 The “manner” of death does not rule out the possibility of abuse and/or neglect. The Child Protection Specialist and Supervisor need to assess all of the evidence to make that determination. Example: An accidental manner of death does not rule out the possible existence of child abuse or neglect (e.g., an intoxicated mother accidentally hits her child with her vehicle. The manner of death is ruled “accident”; however, the mother was neglectful in driving while intoxicated). Example: A manner of death of undetermined occurs in cases in which there is insufficient information to classify the death as a homicide, accident, natural or suicide. A manner of death of undetermined does not rule out the possible existence of child abuse or neglect (e.g., a child has the presence of non-accidental bruises at the time of death).

procedures-300-appendix-b_25_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 Allegation of Harm #2/52 HEAD INJURIES a) Definitions 1) Head Injuries Serious injuries causing skull fracture, brain damage or bleeding on the brain such as a subdural hematoma or Abusive Head Trauma (Shaken Baby Syndrome). 2) Brain Damage – Option A Direct damage to the brain from blunt or penetrating force or secondary to lack of oxygen (suffocation). 3) Skull Fracture – Option B A break of the bone surrounding the brain. The fracture pattern possibilities include linear or comminuted (more than one fracture). A fracture may be described as depressed which means the bone fragment is displaced. 4) Hematoma – Option C A) Collections of blood outside blood vessels which are injured. B) Depending on the location of the bleeding, the following types of hematomas result: i) Subgaleal hematomas are located outside the skull. They can be seen as a bump or swelling to the scalp. ii) Epidural hematomas occur right under the skull bone; they are intracranial or inside the skull. They can occur from impact to the temporal or side of the head. Blood vessels running under the fracture are severed and blood accumulates under the fracture above the dura mater. iii) Subdural hematomas are collections of blood beneath the dura mater (the tough outer membrane covering the spinal cord and brain). iv) Subarachnoid hematomas are blood collections below another layer of tissue surrounding the brain called the subarachnoid layer.

The effects vary according to the type, duration and intensity of the agent and the part of the body involved. Burns are usually classified as first, second, third or fourth degree. 1) First Degree (Superficial Partial Thickness) Superficial burns in which damage is limited to the outer layer of the epidermis (skin) characterized by scorching or painful redness of the skin. (E.g., sunburn) 2) Second Degree (Full Partial Thickness) Burns in which the damage extends through the outer layer of the skin into the inner layers (dermis).

The following factors should be considered when determining whether an injury that resulted in cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions or oral injuries constitutes an allegation of abuse or neglect: A) The child’s age, mobility and developmental stage; bruises on children younger than 6 months are highly suspicious; B) The child’s medical condition, behavioral, mental, or emotional problems, developmental disability, or physical handicap, particularly as they relate to the child’s potential for victimization; C) A pattern or chronicity of similar instances; however, a single incident can constitute an allegation of abuse or neglect; D) The severity/extent of the cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions or oral injuries (size, number, depth, extent of discoloration); some bruises may fade quickly, such as around a young child’s mouth, but still be considered serious; E) The location of the cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions or oral injuries; accidental bruises are frequently seen over boney areas such as knees, shins, the forehead, and other exposed bony surfaces. Facial bruises or bruises located on padded areas such as the torso, buttocks, cheeks, genitalia, or on relatively protected areas like the ear lobes, neck or upper lip, or on soft areas such as the stomach are highly suspicious; F) The pattern of the injury; G) Was an object/instrument was used on the child; H) Previous history of indicated abuse or neglect; and I) History of previous injuries.

procedures-300-appendix-b_75_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 5) Assessment Factors and Evidence to Determine a Final Finding Factors to be considered include: A) What is the child’s age, mobility and developmental stage? Is the child able to sit up, crawl or walk? The less mobile the child is, the less likely the child is to receive accidental bruising. B) Does the child have a medical condition; behavioral, mental or emotional problems; any disability or handicap that impacts the child’s ability to protect him or herself or that significantly increases a caregiver’s stress level? C) Is there a pattern of similar instances with the child or other children for whom the parent/caregiver has been responsible? Note: One incident is sufficient to indicate a report of abuse or neglect. D) What is the severity and location (E.g., size, number, depth of cut and extent of discoloration of the bruising) of the injury to the child’s head, face or body? E) Accidental bruising usually occurs over bony prominences such as the knees, shins, forehead or elbows. Injuries to the cheeks, ears, genital, thighs and buttocks are more likely to be indicative of abusive treatment. Bruises surrounding a child’s mouth may be associated with attempts to force feed or to make a child stop crying. Falls usually produce bruising on a single plane of the body, while inflicted injuries generally occur over multiple planes. F) Was an object or instrument used on the child? The use of an instrument does not in and of itself constitute an indicated finding, but multiple injuries resulting from the use of an instrument is significant. G) Bruises with sharply defined borders are almost always inflicted. An electric cord produces a loop mark, belts produce strap marks and both generally wrap around multiple planes of the body. Boards and paddles may leave linear injuries while other instruments may leave distinctive, patterned injures. H) Is there a previous history of abuse and/or neglect, or do persons interviewed report previous injuries to the child? Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 300.Appendix B",441,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-b.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-b_76_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 I) More weight should be given to a documented history, and DCFS files used as a basis for identifying history should be reviewed prior to being considered a factor. History described by subjects or collaterals (E.g., child injuries, incidents of domestic violence) that is undocumented should be evaluated and factored into the overall assessment of safety. J) What dynamics are present between the child and the parent? K) Identify the child’s level of fear of the caregiver. Does the caregiver appear to be concerned about child’s welfare and protection? Is there an appropriate parent-child relationship? An apparent lack of fear of the parent/caregiver is only one factor to be considered and does not mean the child is not being abused or neglected. L) Was the injury inflicted through corporal punishment? Corporal punishment suggests non-accidental or intentional injury. An assessment of the intentional injury must be made to determine if the corporal punishment was excessive. M) Is the explanation of the injury consistent with the injury?

procedures-300-appendix-b_153_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 Allegation of Harm #81 FAILURE TO THRIVE (NON-ORGANIC) a) Definition 1) Failure to thrive is a serious medical condition most often seen in children less than one year of age, but can occur in children up to 3 years of age. The child’s weight, height, weight for length, and motor development fall significantly short of the average growth rates of normal children (E.g., below the fifth percentile). Failure to thrive is the failure to achieve expected growth. More precisely, the medical problem is that the child is malnourished. The severity of the malnutrition must be assessed by the medical provider using appropriate growth charts. 2) In a small percentage of failure to thrive cases there is an organic cause such as a serious kidney, heart, or intestinal disease, a genetic error of metabolism or brain damage. Commonly, in non-organic failure to thrive there is a disturbed parent/child relationship that manifests itself as physical and emotional neglect of the child. Diseases or medical conditions (organic) that cause growth failure and psychosocial reasons (non-organic) that cause growth failure are often found concurrently so there needs to be consideration of multifactorial conditions. b) Taking a Report 1) A child has failure to thrive syndrome as a result of the blatant disregard of caregiver responsibilities by a parent, caregiver or other person responsible for the child’s welfare. (NEGLECT) 2) Factors to be considered include: A) The child’s weight is below the fifth percentile of the normal range for a child of that age; or the child’s weight has dropped more than two major percentiles; but substantial weight gain occurs when the child is properly nourished and nurtured, such as when hospitalized; B) The child exhibits improved motor development when there is adequate feeding and appropriate stimulation; and C) Medical examination provides no evidence that disease or medical abnormality is the sole cause for the symptoms. 3) It must be taken into consideration that, when assessing potential Failure to Thrive reports and conducting investigation of a child suspected of suffering from Failure to Thrive, that Failure to Thrive is a multifactorial condition and the existence of an organic cause does not preclude an accompanying non-organic cause.

procedures-300-appendix-b_165_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 16, 2022 – PT 2022.09 Allegation of Harm #85 MEDICAL NEGLECT OF DISABLED INFANTS a) Definition 1) Medical neglect of a disabled infant means the withholding of appropriate nutrition, hydration, medication or other medically indicated treatment from a disabled infant with a life-threatening condition. Medically indicated treatment includes medical care which is most likely to relieve or correct all life-threatening conditions and evaluations or consultations necessary to assure that sufficient information has been gathered to make informed medical decisions. Nutrition, hydration, and medication, as appropriate for the infant’s needs, are medically indicated for all disabled infants. Other types of treatment are not medically indicated when: A) The infant is chronically and irreversibly comatose; B) The provision of the treatment would be futile and would merely prolong dying; or C) The provision of the treatment would be virtually futile and the treatment itself would be inhumane under the circumstances. 2) In determining whether treatment will be medically indicated, reasonable medical judgments such as those made by a prudent physician knowledgeable about the case and its treatment possibilities will be respected. Opinions about the infant’s future “quality of life” are not to bear on whether a treatment is judged to be medically indicated. 3) Whenever a hospital has an Infant Care Review Committee, Department Child Protection staff or the Perinatal Coordinator will consult with the committee and will document in writing any disagreements with the committee’s recommendations and the reasons for them. (See Procedures 300.Appendix C) b) Taking a Report 1) A disabled infant has not received/is not receiving medically indicated treatment (includes appropriate nutrition, hydration, and medication and independent evaluations and consultations) due to the blatant disregard of caregiver responsibilities by a parent, caregiver or other person responsible for the child’s welfare.

APPENDIX E: BURGOS CONSENT DECREE The Burgos Consent Decree requires that DCFS in its Cook and Aurora Regions provide services in Spanish to Hispanic clients whose primary language is Spanish. Hispanic is defined as any person of Puerto Rican, Mexican, Central, South American or other Hispanic origin. Although the Burgos Consent Decree only applies to the Department’s Cook and Aurora regions, best practice indicates that the following procedures should be applied statewide whenever child abuse or neglect investigations involve persons of Hispanic origin. a) Reports to SCR Whenever an initial report of child abuse or neglect is received by the State Central Register, the report taker will attempt to determine whether the parents/children who are the subjects of the report are of Hispanic origin and/or Spanish speaking. This will be indicated on a SACWIS intake report. b) Local Investigative Unit If either parent is of Hispanic descent and they or the alleged victims are identified as primarily Spanish speaking by SCR, the supervisor of the receiving investigative unit shall assign the report to a bilingual Investigation Specialist. The bilingual Investigation Specialist must complete the CFS 1000-1/CFS 1000-1S, Hispanic Client Language Determination Form and have it signed by the parents during the first contact with the parents. The investigation will be conducted in the language determined on the CFS 1000-1/CFS 1000- 1S. If a bilingual Investigation Specialist is not available, a non-Spanish speaking investigator may be assigned to initiate the investigation with the help of an interpreter. Interpreters that may be used include police officers, medical or school personnel, therapists and service workers. Subjects of the report and persons making the report may not be used as interpreters. The interpreter shall be informed that all information is confidential and is not to be disclosed. The name, title, location and telephone number of the interpreter or the telephonic interpretation service used shall be documented on a SACWIS contact note. Document translations, in-person and by telephone interpretation services can be obtained through the vendors listed below. Telephone interpretation services can be obtained from Propio Language Services at 1- 866-828-3280; use the DCFS 4 digit account #3871. For 3-way phone connections: Consult with the first person who answers the phone. They will place the 3-way call. The alternate interpreter number, 1-866-386-1284, may be used when the primary line cannot provide the requested language.

If the parents and the alleged victim who are of Hispanic descent are identified as primarily English speaking by SCR, the supervisor of the receiving investigative unit shall assign a bilingual Investigation Specialist, who will have the CFS 1000-1/CFS 1000-1S completed and signed by the parents. If a bilingual Investigation Specialist is not available, the receiving investigative unit will proceed to investigate the report as required by ANCRA to ensure the safety of the child. In this case the CFS 1000-1/CFS 1000-1S will be completed by a bilingual investigator within seven days of receipt of the report. The CFS 1000-1/CFS 1000-1S shall be placed in the case file. The client’s status as a limited/non-English speaking person shall be recorded in the SACWIS Person Management window for each family member. The SACWIS indicator for preferred language must be recorded on the SACWIS Person Management Basic Tab. When the preferred language recorded in not English, the Interpreter Needed indicator is also required. Workers receiving a new or transferred case should always review the preferred language window to determine the client’s communication needs. c) Protective Custody If protective custody is taken and the placement of children in substitute care is required, a bilingual protective service investigator will attempt to complete the CFS 1000-1/CFS 1000- 1S before the placement is made or prior to the court hearing for the adjudication of temporary custody. In addition, every effort will be made to place the child or children with foster parents who are able to communicate in Spanish. d) Communication All individual or general written communication to Spanish-speaking clients by DCFS workers or vendors must be in Spanish. e) Non-Cooperation If clients of Hispanic origin refuse to sign the CFS 1000-1/CFS 1000-1S, investigative staff may proceed with the investigation.

By entering substitute care, they experience such obvious losses as familial relationships, school and/or peer relationships, and their actual home settings. If they have experienced multiple placements, changing families or caregivers numerous times, they experience losses such as the loss of cultural bonds, family traditions or daily routines. Many, if not most, of the changes in the lives of these children are thrust upon them; it is not in their power to alter the events and circumstances that deeply and permanently impact their lives. The initial separation of a child from the home of his/her parents or foster parents is at least anxiety- producing, and, at most, severely traumatic. For children who have been in multiple substitute placements, the effects of loss are profound and long-term. Factors Affecting Child's Feelings of Anxiety and Loss The extent to which children's lives are impacted by the separation from their caregiver(s), is dependent upon: • the age(s) at which they experience the separation(s); • the types of loss(es)/separation(s) they experienced; • the circumstances around the loss(es)/separation(s); • their responses to the loss(es)/separation(s): and • the help and support they were given at the time. Indicators of Separation Anxiety Children may experience any or all of the following types of emotional and behavioral reactions brought about by separation from their families: • depression (potentially leading to self-destructive and/or suicidal behavior); • physical aggression towards others; • an inability to form healthy attachments to adults, or have adults form attachments to them; • emotional delays, such as problems developing self-esteem, being aware of their own feelings or the feelings of others, and/or developing consciences; • intellectual delays, such as problems developing organized and logical thought processes; • social delays, such as general problems in getting along with other adults and children; and/or, • a range of physical developmental delays. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",459,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_14_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT July 30, 2014 – P.T. 2014.15 Children's reactions to separation and loss multiply each time they experience this trauma. Emotional and behavioral responses such as those previously described may jeopardize current placements, and increase the probability of restrictive future placements. The possibility that these types of losses can so severely impact the current and future functioning of children makes it imperative that this is addressed in a supportive and therapeutic manner at all stages of the assessment and service planning processes. What Workers Can Do The Department's consistent attention to permanency planning is ""...based on the premise that stability in living arrangements and continuity of relationships with parental figures promotes children's worth and development."" The child welfare system must acknowledge the critical importance of separation and loss to a child’s long-term protection and permanency and act to decrease the subsequent impact. Because separation and loss, and the resulting separation anxiety and grief, occur at various times throughout placement, the child protection specialist should be aware of the impact of this dynamic during the initial intervention and placement processes; likewise, the child protection specialist and permanency worker should be aware of the impact of this dynamic upon initial placement and throughout the assessment and service planning processes, particularly for children who experience multiple placements. Department and Purchase of Service staff are expected to use the ""Guidelines for Minimizing the Effects of Separation and Loss in Substitute Care"", below, to prepare and assist with the adjustment of children that are placed. Issues about the separation and loss children experience should be reviewed throughout the assessment process. The Guidelines shall be followed each time a child is placed in substitute care. These Guidelines apply to the initial substitute placement and any subsequent placement changes, such as when a child is moved from one foster home to another foster home, foster care to residential placement, etc. If, at any time, the child protection specialist or permanency worker becomes aware of any unmet needs during the initial or a subsequent placement process the child protection specialist/permanency worker shall share that information with appropriate Department or POS agency staff who need to know. GUIDELINES FOR MINIMIZING THE EFFECTS OF SEPARATION AND LOSS IN SUBSTITUTE CARE CHILD'S NEEDS: • Encourage the child to ask questions and express his/her feelings about the separation and placement. • Help the child select a favorite possession(s) to take with him/her.

PLACEMENT: When placing a sibling group, the child protection specialist shall document the reason for the placement selection in the investigation file. The placement selection criteria set out below are mandatory, and compliance shall be documented. • Every effort should be made to place siblings together at the time they enter care and when placement changes are necessary. Priority shall be given to caregivers who can accept an entire sibling group. Child protection specialists shall comply with Rules and Procedures 402, Licensing Standards for Foster Family Homes and Procedures 301.80, Unlicensed Relative Home Placements when making placements of children in a foster home. “Sibling” are children who have at least one parent in common. Adopted siblings and siblings in guardianship are still considered siblings if they were in DCFS care under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act immediately prior to the adoption or guardianship. Step-siblings may be considered “siblings” when the children enter into substitute care together and have a positive relationship. For placement purposes, step-siblings who enter care together shall be placed together initially, and placement shall be re-evaluated after the Integrated Assessment. If a joint placement for all of the siblings cannot be located, every effort shall be made to select caregivers who will encourage and support frequent contact and visitation among the siblings. The child protection specialist or permanency worker shall ensure that the caregivers and each member of the sibling group entering placement have received the DCFS publication CFS 105-95, How to Connect With Your Brothers and Sisters. If siblings cannot be placed together (in accordance with Rule 301.70), every effort should be made to place the siblings in homes or programs that will encourage and support the sibling relationship. Note: Placement of an add-on child with his/her sibling who has been adopted or in subsidized guardianship is a relative placement.

It is a ""life-of-the case"" protocol designed to provide workers with a mechanism for quickly assessing the potential for moderate to severe harm immediately or in the near future and for taking quick action to protect children. Workers utilize the protocol to help focus their decision-making to determine whether a child is safe in their home environment and, if unsafe, deciding what measures or actions must be taken to ensure the safety of the child. Even if a child is not in the home, e.g., if a child victim is in a hospital, the CERAP safety assessment is to be based on the child’s return home. The major steps that are required to apply the protocol include an assessment and analysis of the safety threats, the completion of the CERAP and implementation and monitoring of the CFS 1441-A, Safety Plan, when necessary. The CFS 1441-A (Safety Plan) is a carbonized form intended to be completed by the investigator or worker in the home with copies left with the primary caregiver and the person most responsible for carrying out the safety plan, if different than the child’s primary caregiver. Department staff and contracted private agency staff are required to utilize the Child Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol (CERAP) at the specified time frames and at any other time when the worker believes that a child may be unsafe. 1) CERAP is a familial assessment only; it is not completed during the investigation of facility reports, i.e., investigations involving foster homes, residential facilities, schools, or day care facilities. 2) Any child safety threats identified as the result of the CERAP must be incorporated into the SACWIS Family Service Plan. b) Definitions ""Severity of the Behavior/Condition"" means the likely degree of harm involved children are subjected to by a behavior/condition that is the responsibility of a caregiver. This degree of harm can range from low to moderate to severe. ""Moderate to Severe Harm"" means a serious threat of danger to a child's life or health, impairment to his or her physical or mental well-being, or disfigurement. ""Immediately or in the Near Future"" means that an incident can occur now or in the very near future i.e., before the next time department or contracted child welfare staff see a child, if no protective action is taken to ensure the child's safety.

Note: A putative father would fall under the definition of paramour. “Prevention Services”(formerly Child Welfare Intake Evaluation) means non- investigatory services directed to preserving families where children remain in their home without a threat to their safety. Prevention services can take the form of providing families with neighborhood/community linkages and advocacy services on a voluntary/self referral basis. They also may include, but are not limited to, court ordered services such as assessments and visitation orders from Marriage and Dissolution court. ""Safe” means that, after considering all reasonably available information/evidence concerning the presence of each of the 16 potential safety threats, and taking into account the vulnerability of the child, and considering the caregiver(s)’s displayed ability/action to mitigate any identified threats, it is determined that a child in a household or in custodial care is not likely to be moderately or severely harmed immediately or in the near future. “Safety Plan” means a voluntary, temporary, short-term plan designed to control serious and immediate threats to children’s safety as a result of an unsafe finding on the CERAP. Safety Plans can take a variety of forms and are developed with the input and voluntary consent of the children’s legal caregivers and other family members. Safety plans are typically short term environmental manipulations to ensure child safety; they are not interventions designed to change behaviors over the long term. Note: Safety Plans are not completed during investigations of foster homes, residential facilities, schools or day care facilities. When there is a formal investigation in these facilities, and the alleged perpetrator is a household member or another person in the facility, children are then protected by the implementation a protective plan, per Procedure 383 The CFS 1441-A (Safety Plan) is a carbonized form intended to be completed by the investigator or worker in the home with copies left with the primary caregiver and the person most responsible for carrying out the safety plan, if different than the child’s primary caregiver.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_21_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 15, 2013 – P.T. 2013.06 ""Unsafe” means that, after considering all reasonably available information/evidence concerning the presence of each of the 16 potential safety threats, and taking into account the vulnerability of the child, and considering the caregiver(s)’s displayed ability/action to mitigate any identified threats, it is determined that a child in a household or in custodial care is likely to be moderately or severely harmed immediately or in the near future. In the event a child is considered Unsafe, a safety plan or protective custody must be implemented by the worker completing the CERAP, and approved by the supervisor. c) Safety Concepts The Child Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol (CERAP) is a process whose purpose is to identify the likelihood of moderate to severe harm, i.e. safety threats, in the immediate future. When immediate risk to a child's safety is identified, the protocol requires that action be taken, such as the implementation of a safety plan or protective custody. Identified safety threats and the safety plan to control them must be documented in SACWIS and the CFS 1441-A, Safety Plan. Safety threats are restricted to the essential criteria of immediacy and severity or potential degree of harm. Since risk allows a broader concept for evaluation of the family, safety threats are depicted within the broader meaning of risk. The purpose of the broader area of risk is not control, but rather to decrease the risk of future maltreatment and resolve problems that cause risk. Safety threats must be controlled and risk factors may be resolved or reduced. The primary purpose of the CERAP is to immediately control the situation to prevent harm from occurring in the short-term. The primary purpose of risk assessment is to reduce or resolve the problems that lead to risk. Safety and risk both require intervention in order to prevent harm, however safety must always be assessed quickly, while risk may be assessed over a longer period of time. Safety and risk are different in two important ways: 1) Time Element: • Safety considers danger of harm now or in the very near future. • Risk considers a longer-term threat, e.g. a child may be at risk months into the future. 2) Potential Degree or Severity of Harm: • Safety is concerned with the potential for moderate to severe harm. • Risk is concerned with the full range of severity of harm, i.e., from low to severe.

If any change in the safety status of any child has been identified at any time, a new CERAP safety assessment must be completed. e) STEPS FOR COMPLETING THE CHILD ENDANGERMENT RISK ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL Safety Threat Assessment Safety threats are behaviors or conditions that may be associated with a child or children being in danger of moderate to severe harm immediately or in the near future. All children residing in the home are to be seen, and if verbal, interviewed out of the presence of the caregiver and alleged perpetrator, if possible. When completing the CERAP, consider the effect any adult or other member of the household could have on a child’s safety. Identify the presence of each threat by checking “Yes” on the CERAP, which is defined as there is “clear evidence or other cause for concern.” The simple presence of any one of the below listed behaviors and/or conditions does not, in and of itself, mean that a child should be determined to be unsafe. When considering the listed behaviors and/or conditions, the following criteria must be considered when assessing the presence of a safety threat: 1) Child Vulnerability: Each safety threat must be considered from the perspective of the threat it poses for the particular children involved. Some children are more vulnerable than others. Factors that influence a child’s vulnerability include, but are not limited to: Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",516,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf

Severity may refer to the degree or extent of an alleged maltreatment incident e.g., a child with multiple and/or serious injuries or it may refer to the degree to which a caregiver’s behavior threatens child safety, e.g., a caregiver whose substance abuse is severe enough to threaten child safety. Severity is concerned with the degree of potential for harm given the behavior. 3) History: A safety threat must be considered in the context of any known or alleged previous examples of safety threats. Anecdotal reports about safety threats must be considered, but attempts must be made to verify the information with credible sources. Chronic safety threats must be assessed as posing greater danger to children. Any prior child abuse/neglect history and/or criminal arrest and conviction records, if available, must be evaluated and taken into consideration with respect to child safety. When there are no safety threats that were checked ""YES"", the worker is to summarize the available information which indicates that no child is likely to be in immediate danger of moderate to severe harm. 4) Safety Threat Identification Once a safety threat has determined that a child is not safe, identify: • All children affected. • The caregiver(s) responsible for creating or allowing the safety threat. • The source of information identifying the safety threat.

Safety Threats- 1) A caregiver, paramour or member of the household whose behavior is, or has been, violent and/or out of control. Examples of such behavior include, but are not limited to: • A documented or credibly alleged history of violent activity, the nature of which constitutes a threat to a child. • Hostile physical or verbal outbursts directed at a child. • Behavior that indicates a serious lack of self-control, e.g., acting reckless, unstable, a volatile or explosive temperament towards a child. 2) A caregiver, paramour or member of a household suspected of abuse or neglect that resulted in moderate to severe harm to a child or who has made a plausible threat of such harm to a child. Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • Any caregiver who may have caused or allowed moderate to severe injury to a child. • A child who has injuries and reasonable information suggests that they may be non-accidental. • An infant with an unexplained injury. • Direct or indirect threats, that are believable, to cause harm to a child. • Plans to retaliate against a child for causing or cooperating with a CPS investigation. • Torture or excessive physical force or punishment. 3) A caregiver, paramour or member of the household who has a documented history of perpetrating child abuse/neglect or any person for whom there is a reasonable cause to believe that he/she previously abused or neglected a child. The severity of that maltreatment, coupled with the caregiver’s failure to protect, suggests that child safety may be an urgent and immediate concern. Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • Previous abuse or neglect that was serious enough to cause or could have caused moderate to sever harm. • A caregiver is known to have retaliated or threatened retaliation against a child. • An escalating pattern of maltreatment. • A caregiver who does not acknowledge or take responsibility for prior moderate to severe harm inflicted to a child or tries to explain away prior incidents of moderate to severe harm. • Unreported, but credible, anecdotal accounts of prior maltreatment.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_28_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 15, 2013 – P.T. 2013.06 • Efforts to conceal evidence of moderate to severe harm, e.g., child required to wear long pants, long sleeved shirts to conceal bruises or other marks or caregiver applies makeup to conceal marks. 4) Child sexual abuse is suspected and circumstances suggest that child safety may be an immediate concern. Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • A child forced or encouraged to engage in sexual performance or activity, including, e.g., sexually gratifying a caregiver or others. • A possible or confirmed perpetrator who continues to have access to a child. • The caregiver does not believe or support the allegations of sexual abuse made by a child. • The child is allowed or forced to watch or read pornographic materials. 5) A caregiver, paramour or member of the household is hiding the child, refuses access, or there is some indication that a caregiver may flee with the child. Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • A family has previously fled in response to a CPS or police investigation. • A family has removed child from a hospital against medical advice. • A family has history of keeping a child at home and/or away from peers, school or other outsiders for extended periods. • The family says they may flee or it appears as they are preparing to flee. 6) Child is fearful of his/her home situation because of the people living in or frequenting the home. Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • A child cries, cowers, cringes, trembles or otherwise exhibits fear in the presence of certain individuals or verbalizes such fear. • A child exhibits severe anxiety (e.g., nightmares, insomnia) that appears to be associated with someone in the home. • A child has reason to expect retribution or retaliation from caregivers. • A child is isolated from extended family members or others with whom the child feels safe. 7) A caregiver, paramour, or member of the household describes or acts toward the child in a predominantly negative manner. Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • Describing a child in demeaning or degrading terms, such as evil, stupid, ugly, a liar, a thief, etc. • Cursing at a child in a demeaning, degrading, and/or hostile manner. • Using a particular child as a scapegoat.

Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • The child is expected to perform or act in a way that is impossible or improbable for the child's age, e.g., babies and toddlers expected not to cry or to be still for extended periods; young children to be toilet trained, eat neatly or take responsibility beyond their years. • Appearing to interpret child’s non-compliance as defiance of caregiver/paramour’s authority. • Punishment is imposed that is beyond the ability of a child at that age to endure. 9) A caregiver, paramour or member of the household expresses credible fear that he/she may cause moderate to severe harm to a child. An example of such behavior includes, but is not limited to: • A father who reports he is going to physically harm his teen-aged son because the child’s behavior is out of control. • A parent who reports she intends to drop her child out of a 2nd story window. 10) A caregiver, paramour or member of the household has not, will not, or is unable to provide sufficient supervision to protect a child from potentially moderate to severe harm. Examples of such behavior include, but are not limited to: • The caregiver places a child in situations that are likely to require judgment or actions greater than the child’s level of maturity, physical condition, and/or mental abilities. e.g., although caregiver present, child can wander outdoors alone, play with dangerous objects, play on an unprotected window ledge or be exposed to other serious hazards. • A caregiver leaving a child alone longer than would be safe, given the child’s age and developmental state. • A caregiver makes inadequate or inappropriate child care arrangements or demonstrates very poor planning for a child's care, e.g., a two-year old who is left home alone, a seven-year old who is left to care for his one and two-year old sisters. 11) A caregiver, paramour or member of the household refuses to or is unable to meet a child’s medical or mental health care needs and such lack of care may result in moderate to severe harm to the child. Examples include, but are not limited to: • A caregiver failing to seek treatment for a child's immediate and dangerous medical or mental health condition.

Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • A child denied food and/or drink on a consistent or ongoing basis; or • A child appearing malnourished. • A child without adequate warm clothing in cold months or adequate housing or emergency shelter. • A gas leak from a stove or furnace, peeling lead-based paint accessible to a child, or hot water/steam leaks from radiators. • Dangerous substances or objects stored in unlocked lower shelves, cabinets, under a sink. • A significant amount of raw garbage in the household that has not been disposed of properly. 13) A caregiver, paramour or member of the household whose alleged or observed substance abuse may seriously affect his/her ability to supervise, protect or care for the child. An example of such behavior includes, but is not limited to; • A caregiver, paramour or household member whose substance abuse significantly impairs their ability, or is likely to impair their ability, to provide care for a child. • A caregiver, paramour or household member’s substance abuse would cause them to inflict moderate to severe harm to a child or allow a child to come to moderate to severe harm. • A caregiver, paramour or household member’s substance abuse extends to selling and or manufacturing drugs while a child is present or in proximity. 14) A caregiver, paramour or member of the household whose alleged or observed mental/physical illness or developmental disability may seriously impair or affect his/her ability to provide care for a child. Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • A caregiver who hears voices telling them to harm a child. • A child who has become a part of their caregiver’s delusional system. • A caregiver’s behavior that seems out of touch with reality and/or is extremely irrational. • A caregiver lacking the physical or intellectual capacity to safely care for a child. • A caregiver who is not able and/or willing to engage in needed supports such as medications or mental health services, resulting in harm to a child or likely harm to a child.

Examples of such include, but are not limited to: • A domestic violence abuser who exhibits controlling behaviors. • A domestic violence abuser who has stalked the caregiver and/or child. • A domestic violence abuser who has threatened to kill or harm the caregiver and/or child. • A domestic violence abuser who recently displayed a violent outburst that resulted in injury or threat of injury to a child or the caregiver while child was in his/her care. • A caregiver who is unable to provide basic care and supervision for a child due to an injury or incapacitating condition, forced isolation or other controlling behavior forced upon them by an a domestic violence abuser. • A caregiver forced under threat of harm to participate in or witness moderate to severe harm of a child and/or a child being forced under threat of moderate to severe harm to witness or participate in the abuse of the caregiver. • A caregiver or child who has injuries the caregiver denies were inflicted by a domestic violence abuser, despite evidence to the contrary. • A caregiver with a history of abusing a child after incidents of domestic violence in which the caregiver was the victim. 16) A caregiver, paramour, member of the household or other person responsible for the child’s welfare engaged in or credibly alleged to be engaged in human trafficking poses a safety threat of moderate to severe harm to any child in the home. Examples of such safety threats include, but are not limited to: • Any caregiver who causes or allows a child to be coerced to perform labor. • Any caregiver causing or allowing a child to be used for domestic servitude or peonage (labor provided to settle a debt). • Any caregiver who causes or allows a child to be used for commercial sexual exploitation, i.e., prostitution, the production of pornography or for sexually explicit performance. • Any caregiver who exposes a child to an environment or set of circumstances that places them at risk of being harmed or exploited, in a manner consistent with the definition of human trafficking. Safety Threat Description When safety threats have been identified, describe how the particular threat relates to specific individuals, behaviors, conditions and circumstances. Note: When No safety threats have been identified, indicate the CERAP is Safe.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_32_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 15, 2013 – P.T. 2013.06 Family Strengths/Mitigating Circumstances Most often when a safety threat has been identified as present, children must be assessed as unsafe. When families are themselves able to control behaviors or conditions that would otherwise render their children unsafe, the safety threat is mitigated. In order for a family strength or action to constitute mitigation, it must take place on the initiative of family members and not at the suggestion or instigation of the Department. When the Department suggests or instigates an action in response to an identified safety threat, the action is part of a safety plan. For each safety threat checked “yes” in Section 1, describe in detail any family strengths or actions that mitigate the identified behavior/condition. If one or more safety threats have been identified and all identified safety threats are adequately controlled by family strengths or actions, all involved children must be assessed as safe. Identify family members and others responsible for assuring that each mitigating action or circumstance occurs/continues. Safety threats may be mitigated when: 1) Caregivers, acting on their own initiative, take reasonable action(s) to correct dangerous behaviors/conditions. For example, a family may move in with relatives while dangerous conditions in the home are corrected. 2) There is an adult caregiver residing in the home who is willing and able to control the identified behavior/condition. This may be a parent, relative, or other adult who is present in the home (who is not the source of the safety threat) whenever affected children are there. In order for a caregiver to be deemed willing and able to control an identified safety factor, he/she must: • Demonstrate an understanding of the identified safety threat(s) and the need for protection. • Believe that maltreatment may have occurred, is serious, and that the alleged perpetrator(s) may have been responsible. • Believably express a willingness and commitment to act to protect all involved children and has not demonstrated an unwillingness or lack of commitment to act to protect all involved children in the past. • Believably express a willingness to communicate with Department staff about the family’s situation with particular regard to identified safety threats. • Display the physical, intellectual, and emotional capacity to ensure the child(ren)’s protection.

In order to be considered mitigation, this action must be done on the initiative of the family. The absence of an alleged perpetrator because of outside intervention (i.e., arrest) does not constitute initiative of the family unless they actively sought law enforcement intervention. As an example of initiative, a mother may obtain an order of protection requiring that a violent father leave the home, a substance abusing parent may enter inpatient substance abuse treatment without the intervention of the Department. When safety threats are mitigated, the assigned worker, in consultation with his or her supervisor, shall ensure the mitigated circumstances remain mitigated through the course of his or her work while assigned to the case. Facts supporting mitigation must be verified and cannot be based solely on self-report. If a safety threat is no longer able to be mitigated, this change in status would require the completion of a new CERAP. g) Children, Caregivers, Paramours or Members of the Household Who Were Not Assessed and the Reasons Why If a child, caregiver, paramour or member of the household has not been included in the assessment, list who they are and why they were not assessed. When one of these members is assessed and the assessment changes the results of the current assessment, a new CERAP safety assessment must be completed. If the assessment does not change, the worker shall indicate this by opening the “Reason not Assessed” drop down box in the Members tab and returning it to no selection made (blank). The supervisor shall approve the addition of the participant. If any change in the safety status of any child has been identified at any time, a new assessment must be completed. h) Critical Decisions CERAP/Safety Decisions - Identify the safety decision as safe or unsafe based upon the assessment of all safety threats and any pertinent mitigating family strengths and/or actions. This decision requires supervisory consultation via phone at the time of assessment. 1) If no safety threats are identified, all involved children must be assessed as safe. 2) If one or more safety threats have been identified and all identified safety threats are adequately controlled by family strengths or actions, all involved children must be assessed as safe. The fact that a child might be safe is independent from the decision regarding whether the allegation is indicated or not.

When a decision is made that a child is unsafe, a safety plan must be developed and implemented or protective custody must be taken to avoid immediate danger to a child. i) Signatures and Distribution of Form The CERAP must be completed by the assigned worker and approved by the respective supervisor after completion. The supervisor or designee shall approve the CERAP within 24 hours after the worker has completed it, if a safety threat has been marked “unsafe”. If no safety threat has been marked unsafe and the worker has completed the CERAP on a weekend or holiday and more than 24 hours will elapse before the supervisor or designee can approve, the supervisor or designee shall approve the form on the next working day. j) Safety Planning Safety plans are voluntary, temporary and short term measures designed to control serious and immediate threats to children's safety. They must be adequate to ensure the child’s safety and be as minimally disruptive to the child and family as is reasonably possible. Additionally, families can request that a safety plan be modified or terminated at any time. The Safety Plan will indicate which Safety Threat or Threats have led to the need for a Safety Plan according to the completion of the CERAP. The Safety plan will require a written description of what will be done or what actions will be taken to protect children, who will be responsible for implementing the components of the safety plan and how/who will monitor it. It is important that safety plans be developed with the family to control specific threats and that the family understands the mechanism for ending each safety plan. Under no circumstance is a safety plan to serve as the solution to a long-term problem. A family may request at any time to modify or terminate the safety plan. When a safety plan is implemented, it should be documented on a CFS 1441-A when it is likely that a child could be moderately or severely harmed now or in the very near future. The safety plan must be developed whenever there are protective efforts that would reasonably ensure child safety and permit the child to remain in their caregiver’s custody. After the safety plan has been developed, it must be immediately implemented to ensure that all of the designated tasks are completed effectively. The safety plan should contain timeframes for implementation and continued monitoring. The family must be informed that their participation in the development and implementation of the safety plan is voluntary and, to the extent safely possible, the worker must enlist the family’s participation in the safety plan’s development Consideration should be given to a non-custodial parent when developing the safety plan. The worker must consider the legal relationship between the alleged perpetrator and the alleged child victim and other children in the home who will be involved in the safety plan.

When developing a safety plan with the family, the worker should include those legally responsible for the child in every aspect of safety planning when possible. If the worker is unable to include an individual who is legally responsible for the child, the worker will make every effort to contact the individual as soon as possible to discuss the safety plan. Consideration should be given to those individuals the child identifies as a person with whom he/she feels safe and trusts. When a biological parent or person legally responsible for the child indicates he or she is divorced, in the process of divorcing or involved in court proceedings regarding custody of the child, the worker must ask the individual about any custody or visitation agreements that are in place as a result of a divorce or a court order. When circumstances meet the standard to take protective custody, the Department and other agents authorized by law can take protective custody regardless of the existence of court-ordered custody or visitation plans. If there is an existing court-ordered custody or visitation schedule, any party to the court order whose rights are affected by the safety plan must voluntarily agree to the terms of the safety plan by signing it. The worker should request any court orders or custody agreements that the individual can provide. If the worker feels there is a need to request the individual forego his or her visitation according to a court order or court approved agreement in order to implement a safety plan, the individual would need to agree to voluntarily suspend his or her visitation. If the person legally responsible for the child does not agree to the safety plan, the worker should consult with his or her supervisor for further direction. Possible solutions could be developing another safety plan that can be agreed upon, one of the legally responsible individuals going to court to modify the custody provisions or taking protective custody. Workers and supervisors must remember that a safety plan cannot be implemented after protective custody has lapsed due to the local State’s Attorney office NOT filing a petition in Juvenile Court, unless relevant new facts are learned. When a States Attorney Office declines because further information is needed, it is not the same as a refusal to file. When the safety plan is developed, the worker must explain it to the family and must inform the family about the potential consequences if the safety plan is refused or violated. If the family refuses to accept the safety plan or if the safety plan is violated, the worker must reassess the situation. Upon reassessment, the worker shall inform the family of the need to develop a new safety plan, possible protective custody and/or a referral to the State’s Attorney’s Office for a court order. The worker shall document the family's agreement and commitment in the appropriate case record as described below under Signatures and Distribution of Safety Plan.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_36_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 15, 2013 – P.T. 2013.06 k) In-home Safety Plans Some safety plans may be implemented with family members remaining together. When in- home safety plans adequately ensure child safety they are preferable because they are less disruptive to the lives of children and families. Required factors for in-home safety plans include all of the following: • The caregivers are willing to implement the in-home safety plan and be reasonably cooperative with those persons participating in carrying out the safety plan. • Steps outlined in the safety plan must be immediate. • The safety plan must be action-oriented and contain specific changes needed to control identified safety threats. • Safety plans must never be based on promissory commitments from caregivers, e.g., an abuse perpetrator promises to attend counseling or not to use excessive corporal punishment or a neglectful perpetrator promises not to leave children unsupervised. • The safety plan must be reasonable and sustainable for the family. • Consider should be given to the involvement of those individuals the child identifies as a person with whom he/she feels safe and trusts. l) In-home Safety Plan: Protective Caregiver In-home safety plans may include the introduction of a protective caregiver into the home. The DCFS or private agency worker must work with the family to identify someone willing and able to fulfill the protective caregiver role. The protective caregiver is to oversee and supervise all child care activities whenever the children are present. It is not realistic to expect that a protective caregiver can prevent all unsupervised contact between the child and the caregiver responsible for the safety threat when they reside in the same home. Therefore, if any unsupervised contact between the child and the caregiver responsible for the safety threat constitutes a danger to the child, the introduction of a protective caregiver may be inadequate. Protective caregivers must: • demonstrate an understanding of the identified safety threat(s) and a child’s need for protection. • believe and understand that maltreatment may have occurred and that the alleged perpetrator(s) may have been responsible. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",419,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf

Note: A CANTS and LEADS check must be completed on all protective caregivers in order to consider the appropriateness of the potential caregiver. m) In-home Safety Plan: Removal of Alleged Perpetrators When there are two caregivers who have a legal relationship with the child and both are present, both must sign the safety plan. Some in-home safety plans may include the voluntary removal of the caregiver responsible for the safety threat. In such cases the “non- offending” caregiver must: • Demonstrate an understanding of identified safety threats and the need for protection. • Believe and understand that maltreatment may have occurred and that the caregiver removed from the home may have been responsible. • Believably express a willingness and commitment to protect all involved children. • Believably express a willingness to communicate with Department staff about the family’s situation with respect to identified safety threats. • Display the physical, intellectual, and emotional capacity to ensure child protection.

In order for a protective caregiver to be deemed willing and able to control an identified safety threat she/he must: • Demonstrate an understanding of identified safety threats and the need for child protection. • Believe and understand that maltreatment may have occurred, and that the alleged perpetrator(s) may have been responsible. • Believably express a willingness and commitment to act to protect all involved children. • Believably express a willingness to communicate with Department staff about the family’s situation with respect to identified safety threats. • Display the physical, intellectual, and emotional capacity to ensure child protection. • Agree to continue with the child’s current academic and social activities. In addition, • A SACWIS and LEADS check must be completed on all adult members of the protective caregiver’s home. • The physical environment of the protective caregiver’s home must be assessed for safety hazards. Every safety plan must specify the conditions under which the safety plan is to be terminated and a time frame when this can be expected to occur. Though safety plans are voluntary and developed in cooperation with the family, the safety plan must also explain the consequences if the caregiver does not agree to implement or fails to carry out the terms of the safety plan. Failure to agree to or carry out the safety plan may result in a reassessment of the home and possible protective custody and/or referral to the State’s Attorney’s Office for a court order to remove the children from the home. The worker developing the safety plan must stress with the protective caregiver that the safety plan is a voluntary, short-term agreement and the legal parent retains all of his or her rights.

The completed safety plan must also be signed by any other persons responsible for implementing the safety plan, as well as any other persons responsible for components of the safety plan. A copy of the completed CFS1441-A shall be given to the primary caregiver, and to the protective caregiver identified in the safety plan, if other than the primary caregiver. The worker will ensure that other individuals involved in the safety plan also receive a copy of the CFS 1441-A. The DCFS or POS agency worker shall include on the form the contact information for the worker and the approving supervisor. The original shall be placed in the child/family case file of the child protection investigator or the assigned caseworker and forwarded to the appropriate service worker when a case is transferred. The respective supervisor or designee shall approve the completed safety plan within 24 hours after the worker has signed it. If the worker has signed the CFS 1441-A on a weekend or holiday and more than 24 hours will elapse before the supervisor can approve the safety plan, the supervisor shall then approve the safety plan in SACWIS on the next working day. In all other instances when the supervisor who gave verbal approval will not be available to approve the safety plan in SACWIS, due to a prolonged absence, another supervisor may approve the safety plan. p) Responsibility for Monitoring and Managing Safety Plans Department staff must ensure that the caregiver responsible for the safety threat has not returned to the home. Department staff may seek assurances that a caregiver responsible for a safety threat has not returned to the home by talking with children or other adults in the home, discussing with neighbors, visiting where the alleged perpetrator currently resides, speaking to school staff, etc. A new CERAP safety assessment must be completed every five working days following the determination that any child in a family is unsafe and a safety plan is implemented. Such assessment must continue until either all children are assessed as being safe, the investigation is completed or all children assessed as unsafe are removed from the legal custody of their parents/caregiver and legal proceedings are being initiated in Juvenile Court. This assessment should be conducted considering the child’s safety status as if there was no safety plan, i.e., would the child be safe without the safety plan? This CERAP safety assessment will determine the point at which a safety plan may be terminated or its conditions modified. When a safety plan has been modified, the worker must obtain the signatures of the parent/caregivers and other adult participants on a new CFS 1441-A and provide the parent/caregivers and other adult participants with a copy of the new CFS 1441- A documenting the conditions of the modified safety plan.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_40_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 15, 2013 – P.T. 2013.06 When a worker implements a safety plan and discovers through the course of his/her work that a safety threat has been eliminated, the worker should immediately discuss this with his or her supervisor in order to assess the need to modify or end the safety plan. When a safety plan is implemented as the result of a Child Protection Investigation, all monitoring and management of the safety plan is the responsibility of the Investigation Specialist. When an investigator implements a safety plan for which he/she will not be responsible, e.g., the investigative specialist on call, the investigator or supervisor will staff the safety plan with the receiving investigator. The receiving investigator will ensure that all involved parties in the safety plan are provided with his/her contact information as the worker responsible for monitoring the plan. The original investigator or supervisor will document the safety plan staffing in a SACWIS note. If there is an open Intact Service case and investigation is open as well, the Investigative Specialist remains responsible for monitoring the safety plan until the investigation is closed. If a safety plan remains in place after the investigation is closed, the Intact Service worker acquires the responsibility for monitoring the safety plan at the transition visit. When cases are transferred, the worker transferring the case shall discuss the case and the terms of the safety plan with the new worker at the time of the case transfer. This responsibility is applicable regardless of whether the worker is DCFS or POS staff. The Department retains sole responsibility for monitoring safety plans. Under no circumstance may safety plan monitoring be delegated to family members or any other persons. q) Ending Safety Plans Safety plans are terminated: • When the family no longer wishes to participate voluntarily in the safety plan. • When the safety threats are no longer present and the safety plan is no longer needed. • At the conclusion of the investigation, regardless of the final finding of the case, unless there is an open service case. • When the safety plan implemented is not sufficient to control safety threats and an alternate safety plan must be developed. The responsible worker must terminate the safety plan using the CFS 1441-B form. A copy of the form must be provided to those legally responsible for the child and those who agreed to be a part of the safety plan. Under no circumstance may contracted or Department staff terminate Department involvement while a safety plan is in effect.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_49_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT March 12, 2004 – PT 2004.07 APPENDIX H – PARAMOUR INVOLVED FAMILIES I. Purpose This Appendix establishes procedural guidelines for the intake and investigation of alleged incidents of child abuse and neglect where a paramour is or is suspected of being part of the family unit. II. Definition of Paramour “Paramour” means a current or ex-boyfriend or girlfriend who has been or may be or is in a care-taking role. The paramour may or may not be residing within the family unit. Paramour involved families may be identified at the time of intake, during a child abuse or neglect investigation or anytime during the life of an open service case. Note: A putative father would fall under the definition of paramour. III. Identification of Paramour Involved Families State Central Register (SCR) staff shall use the screening and assessment factors listed below to screen calls of alleged paramour inflicted physical abuse. LEADS checks should be initiated by SCR staff for reports of physical abuse or risk of non-sexual physical abuse where a paramour is identified as the alleged perpetrator. Child Protective Service Workers (CPSW) shall assess single parent households to determine if a paramour is involved with the parent and children regardless of whether there is acknowledgement by the family that a paramour lives in the household or is significantly involved with the parent and children. The assessment shall include information obtained from the parent, children, extended family, reporter, paramour, school personnel and other social service personnel in order to make an informed assessment of the paramour’s involvement with the family that is essential to the development of viable safety and service plans. IV. Screening and Assessment Upon determination by CPSW that a paramour is involved or suspected of being involved with the family the worker shall utilize the following factors to assess level of risk and safety to the children in the household. Information gathered shall address the characteristics of the paramour, the dynamics of the relationship between the custodial parent and paramour, the custodial parent’s history with paramours and spouses, the custodial parent’s capacity to protect his or her children from abuse, and child factors that may increase the risk of abuse by a paramour. The Paramour Assessment Checklist has been designed to aid in the identification of risk and safety issues specific to paramour involved cases. A “yes” response to any of the listed factors requires that the factor or factors be considered when completing the CERAP, safety plan development/implementation and/or service planning. A “yes” response to any of the factors may or may not require implementation of an intervention to address the identified issue. This decision must be made in consultation with the CPSW supervisor.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_50_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT March 12, 2004 – PT 2004.07 a) Application of Paramour Factors A CFS 1441, Safety Determination Form, must always be completed in accordance with the Child Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol and a safety plan implemented when a child is found to be unsafe. When there are circumstances that mitigate factor number 14 of Section 1 of the CFS 1441 (i.e., A paramour is the alleged or indicated perpetrator of physical abuse.), paramour procedural requirements may be waived by a CPSW manager after consultation with the CPSW. The consultation and waiver must be documented in a SACWIS Case Note. 1) Paramour requirements in Section V cannot be waived if any of the following factors is answered “yes.” If any child is found to be unsafe, then an appropriate safety plan must be developed and implemented. A) The paramour expresses negative attitudes or behaviors towards specific children in the household (e.g., unrealistic expectations for behavior, demeaning verbalizations, excessive corporal punishment, differential treatment as compared to other children in the home, etc.). B) The paramour has been previously indicated as a perpetrator of child abuse or neglect. C) The paramour has a history as an indicated perpetrator of child abuse or neglect in another state. D) There is a history of domestic violence involving the paramour and the custodial parent. E) The custodial parent and/or children express fear of the paramour. 2) The supervisor may waive paramour procedural investigation requirements established in Section V if any of the following factors are answered “yes”. A) The paramour is financially dependent on the custodial parent. B) The paramour is misusing alcohol, prescription drugs, over the counter or illegal drugs. C) The paramour has a criminal background established through a LEADS and local law enforcement records check. D) The paramour has a history of mental illness including a history or current hospitalization and/or treatment. E) There is suspicion of domestic violence involving the paramour and the custodial parent.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_51_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT March 12, 2004 – PT 2004.07 F) The custodial parent has a history of domestic violence with previous paramours or spouses. G) The children are ages 0-10. (Note: Children who are ages six through ten years of age are at high risk and children who are younger than six years of age are at the greatest risk of abuse.) H) The children are hyperactive, behaviorally disordered, sexual behavior problems, physically or mentally handicapped. I) There is another adult in the home who is willing and able to assist with ensuring the safety of the children. Note: This person cannot have a criminal history or have been indicated for abuse or neglect as verified through SACWIS/CANTS, LEADS or law enforcement agency checks.) J) There is a current or pending order of protection against the paramour. K) The paramour has a history of multiple unstable adult relationships. Note: Blended families involving multiple children with different biological parents often-present situations that prevent bonding between the custodial parent, paramour and children, creating a greater risk for abuse. L) The paramour has a history of domestic violence. b) Strengths The basis for a significant, continuous, and stable relationship is established if all the factors in this section are answered “yes.” A “no” response to any of the factors may or may not require the implementation of an intervention to address the identified issue. Factors with a “no” response should be considered when completing the CFS 1441. 1) The custodial parent and his or her children refer to the paramour in positive, affectionate terms to others such as school personnel or extended family. 2) The paramour refers to each child by name in positive, affectionate terms. 3) The paramour is actively involved in child rearing (e.g., childcare, transportation, extra curricular activities, school conferences, provider for medical insurance, medical appointments, etc.).

V. Investigation The following procedures shall be followed for all cases where a paramour has been named as an alleged perpetrator or identified as being involved with the family. a) Interviewing Children of Paramour Households Child victims and non-involved subject children shall be interviewed in a neutral setting without the paramour and/or parent present. Interviews should be conducted in a neutral setting such as a school, day care center, extended family home, DCFS office or any other environment perceived as “safe” by the child. Interviews conducted in the home must be done in an area where the paramour and parent are unable to have eye contact with the children or hear the children’s statements. b) Referral to Law Enforcement A referral to law enforcement must be made and protective custody considered when the investigator is denied access to the children by the paramour and the natural parent is unable or unwilling to permit access. Child Protective Service Workers may request a waiver of these requirements from Child Protection Unit supervisors. The SACWIS Case Note shall be used to document the supervisor’s consultation and information supporting the supervisor’s decision to either approve or deny the waiver request.

A non-offending custodial parent who is fearful of his or her paramour should be interviewed in a neutral setting. d) Corroboration of Credible Information Corroboration of credible information must be sought concerning a custodial parent or paramour’s history of alleged mental illness, domestic violence, drug and/or alcohol abuse, or abusive patterns of discipline when the paramour or natural parent denies such histories. e) Safety Plan An appropriate safety plan must be developed and implemented, if required, and documented on the CFS 1441. This plan may require that the paramour leave the custodial parent’s residence during the investigation. Shelters or extended family should be considered for use as temporary living quarters for custodial parents and children in those situations where they reside in the paramour’s home. The custodial parent should be informed that permitting his or her paramour access to children in violation of an established safety plan may result in the Department taking protective custody of the children and referring the case to Juvenile Court. f) Formal Investigation Procedural Requirements The following are required for all cases that proceed to formal investigation: 1) Collateral Contacts Child Protective Service Workers must make collateral contacts with individuals who can provide information concerning the safety and well being of the children, parental functioning, the quality of the home environment, and the quality and stability of the relationship between the paramour, custodial parent and the custodial parent’s involved children (e.g., extended family members who have had extensive/significant personal contacts, child care providers, social service agencies, neighbors, school and medical personnel).

The Appendix is also intended to provide guidance for addressing domestic violence within the context of a child abuse or neglect investigation. b) Definitions While it is imperative when working with families that experience domestic violence to understand the significant impact domestic violence has on children, it is equally significant to understand the language and resources used to identify and to protect the children. These definitions will aid Department investigative staff and supervisors in recognizing signs, symptoms and resources for domestic violence when assessing for risk and safety as well as intervening with families where domestic violence appears to be evident. The Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 [750 ILCS 60] defines domestic violence as a crime in which physical abuse, harassment, intimidation of a dependent, interference with personal liberty or willful deprivation is perpetrated by one family or household member against another. “Abused Child” means a child whose parent or immediate family member, or any person responsible for the child’s welfare, or any individual residing in the same home as the child, or paramour of the child’s parent: inflicts, causes to be inflicted, or allows to be inflicted upon such child physical injury, by other than accidental means, which causes death, disfigurement, impairment of physical or emotional health, or loss or impairment of any bodily function; creates a substantial risk of physical injury to such child by other than accidental means which would be likely to cause death, disfigurement, impairment of physical or emotional health, or loss of or impairment of any bodily function; commits or allows to be committed any sex offense against such child, as such sex offenses are defined in the Criminal Code of 2012 or in the Wrongs to Children Act, and extending those definitions of sex offenses to include children under 18 years of age; commits or allows to be committed an act or acts of torture upon such child; Illinois Department of Children and Family Services  Table-1: [['""Abuse"" means physical abuse, harassment, intimidation of a dependent, interference'], ['with personal liberty or willful deprivation but does not include reasonable direction of a'], ['minor child by a parent or person in loco parentis.

[750 ILCS 60/103(15)] c) Domestic Violence Research Findings 1) Research shows that domestic violence perpetrators do not only victimize adults. Adult domestic violence and child maltreatment are often co-occurring. Research examining the intersection of child maltreatment and domestic violence shows: A) Domestic violence is present in 30 to 60 % of child welfare cases. (Appel et al, 1998; Edleson, 1999) B) Domestic violence is considered a major risk factor for fatal child abuse. (National Center for Fatality Review and Prevention, 2019) C) A substantial number of female caregivers in families referred to child protective services have experienced physical violence perpetrated by an intimate partner. (Hazen et al., 2004) D) Among children who have witnessed domestic violence, over half (56.8%) have also experienced one or more forms of maltreatment. (Hamby et al., 2010) Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",499,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_84_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT June 6, 2022 – P.T. 2022.03 E) Perpetrators often use their children to control, intimidate and keep track of their partners. (Beeble et al., 2007) 2) Children are uniquely impacted by domestic violence. Some children may experience trauma from observing and hearing their caregivers being abused, which can lead to children exhibiting higher levels of childhood behavioral, social and emotional problems than would children who have not witnessed such violence. When children are secondary victims, research shows that exposure to trauma increases the risk of: A) Eating and sleep disorders; B) Verbally and physically aggressive behaviors; C) Feelings of guilt, when the children believe that they are the cause of the abuse; D) Poor academic performance; E) Becoming easily frightened, anxious, clingy or frequent crying if the children are under the age of five; F) Adolescent alcohol and drug abuse; or G) Teen dating violence (Research shows that youth ages 16 – 24 are most at risk of domestic violence than any other age group. d) Identifying Signs and Symptoms of Domestic Violence The ability to recognize signs and symptoms of domestic violence is possible through knowledge and understanding of language and behaviors associated with domestic violence incidents. The signs and symptoms of domestic violence may be plentiful or they may be discrete and subtle. Some signs may be observable either directly or indirectly as it relates to a single or repetitive incident of domestic violence. Indicators identified directly or indirectly to a given report or investigation do not measure the significance of the information learned. External signs of domestic violence are as significant as those directly learned in reference to a specific incident or situation. This section discusses the language and behaviors demonstrated by domestic violence victims, perpetrators and those closely related to the families living with domestic violence. Recognition of these cues will enable Child Protection Specialists and Supervisors to focus decision-making on the level of interventions necessary to assure the safety of children. 1) Signs and Symptoms Directly Related to an Incident of Domestic Violence. Where domestic violence is suspected or reported as present, there are some very telling signs and symptoms that should be considered significant indicators (as Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",452,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf

The following is a list of factors that are often directly related to incidents of domestic violence. It is important to note that victims live these experiences from day to day and may consider them normal routine activities, and an outsider will see the risk that they don’t see, and recognize the significance in patterns (such as those listed below) that would otherwise be communicated by the victim as minimal. A) A child is injured as a result of a domestic violence incident; B) The batterer struck the adult victim while victim was holding a child; C) The child is at risk of harm and/or injured while trying to intervene in an incident of domestic violence; D) Weapon(s) are used or brandished in a domestic violence assault; E) Substance misuse contributed to a domestic violence incident; F) Adult victim experienced physical injury such as bruises, cuts, black eyes, strangulation marks on the neck or hospitalization resulting from an incident of domestic violence; G) Adult victim is experiencing or has experienced domestic violence while pregnant; H) Incident involved strangulation, or attempted strangulation of an adult or child victim; I) Batterer has made death threats or threats of serious injury; J) Batterer has stalked or harassed adult victim and children; K) Batterer has committed sexual assault of adult victim; L) There are multiple family stressors (e.g., unresolved grief, prior or concurrent involvement with the Department, unemployment, legal issues); M) The presence of underlying conditions (e.g., mental health, substance misuse and developmental disabilities;) N) The batterer’s whereabouts are unknown; O) There are frequent, chronic domestic violence incidents; P) The adult victim and children have significant fear of the batterer; or Q) The adult victim and children have no plan for protection from domestic violence.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_86_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT June 6, 2022 – P.T. 2022.03 2) External and Significant Indicators of Domestic Violence. External indicators of domestic violence, while not always evident in the initial visits with a family, often appear as the investigation continues. Throughout the life of the investigation, the child protection specialist must continue to avidly assess for external and significant indicators of domestic violence. External indicators may be observed directly by the Child Protection Specialist or reported by a non- household member, a mandated reporter, or reported directly by another household member about past or recent incidents. These indicators may be documented in third-party reports such as medical records, police reports, or documented orders of protection. Such reporting can provide insight into patterns and frequency of incidents of domestic violence that a family experience. The list below highlights factors that are significant indicators of domestic violence. It is important to know these markers may be minimized by both reporters and household members based on their individual history of domestic violence and abuse. However, these factors should be considered when assessing safety concerns and risk of harm for children during an investigation, and should be considered in the determination of an investigation outcome, especially where the primary caregiver does not demonstrate the ability to protect the children. The external and significant indicators discussed in this Appendix should help Child Protection Investigators identify possible domestic violence issues during abuse or neglect investigations. The presence of these external and significant indicators demonstrate that domestic violence is an underlying condition in the family, and should be considered when assessing safety concerns and risk of harm. A) There are frequent, domestic violence incidents involving any member of the family group; B) Adult victim has a history of serious injury; C) Third party or collateral reports of domestic violence; D) Criminal history of assault or damage to property that has been verified through LEADS; E) One partner seems to control everything (e.g., answers questions for the other partner, discourages individual interviews, monopolizes the attention of the worker, silent but uses non-verbal cues to communicate); F) Observed damage to the home (e.g., phone ripped from the wall, holes in the walls, broken doors or furniture); G) Any self-reported incident of domestic violence; Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",457,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf

Assessing for safety and risk must occur throughout the life of the investigation. However, the presence of domestic violence may or may not warrant Department intervention. The Child Protection Specialist must refer to the Child Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol (CERAP) and the Allegation System to determine if the domestic violence in the child’s life rises to the level of abuse or neglect, or poses a threat to the child. 2) The Child Protection Specialist shall identify and assess any and all strategies the adult victim as used in the past that can be supported or strengthened to protect the children. The Child Protection Specialist shall also identify and document whether any of the following protective factors from the Strengthening Families Initiative are present between the non-offending caregiver and children. In 2004, Strengthening Families Illinois (SFI) began as an early childhood primary prevention collaboration convened by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (IDCFS) through a contract with a fiscal agent, Family Focus Inc. In Strengthening Families™ is a research-informed approach to increase family strengths, enhance child development and reduce the likelihood of child abuse and neglect. It is based on engaging families, programs and communities in building five protective factors: A) parental resilience; B) social connections; C) knowledge of parenting and child development; D) concrete support (i.e., food, shelter, clothing, health care); and/or E) social and emotional competence Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",410,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf

(Holmes et al, 2003) 4) For additional information regarding protective factors in domestic violence cases, Child Protection Specialists should consult with a Clinical Domestic Violence Specialist in the Division of Clinical Services’ Domestic Violence Intervention Program. To request a consultation, the Child Protection Specialists shall send a CFS 399-1, Clinical Service Referral Form to DCFS.ClinicalRef@illinois.gov. f) Domestic Violence Interviews 1) Family and collateral contact interviews are critical to identifying and assessing safety concerns and risk of harm for children when domestic violence is a factor. Interviews can be challenging at times, because the questions can appear invasive and uncomfortable for both the family members, collaterals and the interviewer. However, the information needed to assess families living with reported or suspected incidents of domestic violence serve three purposes. First, thorough information gathering aides an investigator in determining if there is a current or past incident of domestic violence. Second, proper questioning can inform an investigator of the frequency and severity of domestic violence incidents. Third, information gathered from interviews aides the investigator and supervisor in the assessment of the caregiver’s ability to mitigate the situation and ability to protect the children. 2) Abusers do not come in a prescribed role. An abuser could hold the role of primary caregiver, current paramour or spouse, or former paramour or spouse. In the discussion in these subsections 1 through 10 (below), the primary caregiver will be referenced as the likely adult victim where domestic violence is occurring. A) Interviewing the Primary Caregiver or Adult Victim. i) An effective interview with an adult victim should inform the interviewer or Child Protection Specialist of the level of risk to the children and the caregiver. It should also reveal the impact that domestic violence is having on the children. ii) Due to factors such as denial and minimization, some adult victims of DV may not be able to comprehend or understand the impact of exposure to violence on children. Some victims may also perceive the DV in their intimate relationship as normal, and as a result, be unable to identify dynamics of power and control that they have experienced, or recognize that these dynamics are indicative of DV. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",535,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_89_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT June 6, 2022 – P.T. 2022.03 iii) In turn, some victims of DV may be very well aware of the intimate partner violence they are experiencing, but may also be facing barriers to accessing services or being able to safely leave the abusive relationship. This makes the need to ask questions regarding the children’s safety a must. This is best accomplished when the interviewer or Child Protection Specialist takes care to establish a rapport with the adult victim immediately. iv) Rapport is crucial when interviewing domestic violence victims and their children because victims are often apprehensive about disclosing and discussing incidents of domestic violence. The adult victim of domestic violence may never have told anyone about the abuse and/or may be very fearful that disclosing the abuse will put herself and her children in danger. v) Explain that the interviewer or Child Protection Specialist cannot grant anyone full disclosure of information that is essential for case planning, service delivery, court actions or Administrative Hearings, and that the interviewer or Child Protection Specialist will work with the adult victim to plan for their safety and the safety of their children. Assure the adult victim that the interviewer or Child Protection Specialist are concerned about their safety, as well as the safety of their children. vi) When domestic violence is suspected as a family dynamic, interviews must be conducted with the adult victim away from the alleged perpetrator. The interviewer or Child Protection Specialist must listen carefully to the responses to get a sense of the relationship between the adult victim and the alleged perpetrator. B) Identifying the Presence of Domestic Violence when Interviewing the Primary Caregiver or Adult Victim. i) In addition to the screening questions for identifying the presence of verbal and/or significant indicators, the statements and questions below are effective for gaining insight into what is going on in the relationship of an adult victim of domestic violence. These talking points will help to facilitate the disclosure and identification of significant indicators of risk: a) Tell me about your relationship. b) How are decisions made in your relationship? c) How are disagreements resolved in your relationship? d) Do you feel free to do, think or believe what you want? e) Do you believe your partner respects you as a person?

That information may be obtained from collateral contacts, LEADS, law enforcement records, medical records, etc. C) Assessing the Severity of Domestic Violence Incidents Through Interviewing a Primary Caregiver or Adult Victim. i) Effective interviewing is not just about having the correct questions to ask, but about having the answers to the questions that provide evidence to support a conclusion. An interviewer or Child Protection Specialist who has established a rapport with the adult victim and employs effective questioning, active listening and effective note taking is more likely to gain the answers to the questions. ii) Answers to the questions below will help identify the perpetrator’s level of power and control over the family, any patterns of domestic violence, and uncover the various forms domestic violence including physical, emotional, mental, social and financial abuse. a) Has the spouse/paramour ever tried to control what the adult victim says and does (e.g., keep them away from their family, friends or neighbors, prevented them from going to work, listened to their phone calls, followed them, controlled their income or how they spend their money)? b) Has the spouse/paramour ever tried to control or limit the adult victims contact with others (e.g., keep them away from their family, friends or neighbors, prevented them from going to work, listened to their phone calls, or followed them)? c) Has the spouse/paramour ever acted in a way that hurt or frightened the adult victim (e.g., threatened to do something harmful, behaved violently in public, forced them to engage in sexual activity, called them degrading names)?

Note: Victims often refer to strangulation as having been choked (e.g., placed a loose or firm object around the neck with pressure, pinned them down, by the neck to the floor, wall or bed with a body part such as arm, elbow or foot). e) Has the spouse/paramour ever pushed, slapped, punched, kicked or hurt the adult victim in other ways (e.g., any physical harm or restraint)? f) Have the children been exposed to incidents of domestic violence (e.g., seen or heard the abuse)? g) Has the spouse/paramour ever called the adult victim derogatory or harsh names, ridiculed them or put them down verbally? Has the spouse/paramour ever done so in front of the children or told the children what was said in order to demean the adult victim? h) Has the spouse/paramour ever threatened to use the children to control the adult victim in any way (e.g., forced the children to participate in the abuse or watch the adult victim being abused, blamed the children for the abuse)? i) Has the spouse/paramour threatened to use a weapon or actually used a weapon to intimidate or physically cause harm to the adult victim or their children? j) Has the spouse/paramour threatened to kill the adult victim or their children, or caused harm to their pets? k) Has the spouse/paramour ever engaged in reckless behavior (e.g., drove too fast with the adult victim and the children in the car)? l) Has the spouse/paramour forced the adult victim to perform sexual acts that make them feel uncomfortable, prevented them from using birth control, withheld sex, caused them harm during pregnancy; forced them to engage in prostitution or pornography? m) Has the spouse/paramour forced the adult victim to use, sell or buy drugs?

The questions below will help the interviewer or Child Protection Specialist to assess the level of risk to the children. a) Has the adult victim been concerned with how the spouse/paramour behaves toward the children? b) When the adult victim speaks on behalf of the children, how does the spouse/paramour respond? c) Has the spouse/paramour threatened to take the children, called or threatened to call DCFS or accused the adult victim of being an unfit parent? d) Has the spouse/paramour threatened to hurt or kill the children? e) Has the spouse/paramour caused harm to the adult victim in front of the children, or hit a child with a belt, strap or other objects? f) Has the spouse/paramour touched a child of the adult victim in a way that made the child feel uncomfortable? g) Has the spouse/paramour assaulted the adult victim while they were holding the child? h) Has the spouse/paramour asked a child of the adult victim to tell him or her what the adult victim is doing during the day, treated one child significantly different from another or forced any of the adult victim’s children to participate in or watch the occurrence of abuse of the adult victim? ii) If a Child Protection Specialist suspects domestic violence is occurring, the Child Protection Specialist might ask the adult victim directly about the experience of their children, such as have any of your children: a) Overheard the yelling and/or violence? b) Behaved in ways that remind the adult victim of their partner? c) Physically hurt the adult victim or other family members? d) Tried to protect the adult victim? e) Tried to stop the violence? f) Intentionally self-injured? g) Been fearful of leaving the adult victim alone? h) Had problems at home, school or day care, such as aggressiveness, violent behaviors, bed-wetting, sleeping problems, nightmares, etc.?

E) Assessing the Primary Caregiver’s or Adult Victim’s Ability to Mitigate Safety Concerns and Risk of Harm. Seeking help can be a difficult task for parents and caregivers living with domestic violence. Evidence of a parent or caregiver seeking assistance to escape domestic violence should be regarded as a strength to build upon to ensure the safety of the children involved. These questions can help the Child Protection Specialist in determining the family’s history of seeking help or intervention. i) Has the adult victim sought help or intervention in the past and if so what happened? Has the adult victim told anyone about the abuse? ii) Has the adult victim seen a counselor and/or left home as a result of, domestic violence? If you left home, where did the adult victim go and did they take their children with them? iii) Has the adult victim called the police, made a criminal complaint, filed for an order of protection or utilized the services of a domestic violence agency or shelter? iv) Has the adult victim ever tried to fight back? F) Interviewing Child Victims Living with Domestic Violence. i) Interviewing children is critical to determine such things as the presence and frequency of domestic violence, and the intensity or severity of incidence of domestic violence that has or is occurring. Child Protection Specialists should use language the children understand when interviewing, and like adult victims, children should be interviewed individually where possible. Younger children may be interviewed together if they are most comfortable with a second member of the family present. Children should not Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",466,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf

Suggested questions for children are divided into the three categories below: a) Child’s account of what he/she saw and/or heard: 1) “What kind of things do you see or hear mom and dad (or name of paramour) fight about?” 2) “What happens when they fight: Have you ever seen or heard them yell at each other? Have you ever seen them hit each other?” 3) “Have you ever seen either your mom or dad (or name of paramour) get hurt?” 4) “Have you ever seen the police come to your house when mom and dad (or name of paramour) fight?” 5) “Have you ever gotten hit or hurt when mom and dad (or name of paramour) were fighting?” b) Impact of witnessing the violence: 1) “How do you feel about your mom and dad (or name of paramour) fighting?” 2) “Do you think a lot about your mom and dad (or name of paramour) fighting? (For example, when you’re in school or while you’re playing?)” 3) “Do you ever have trouble sleeping at night or have a nightmare?” c) Child’s concerns about safety: 1) “What do you do when your mom (or name of paramour) are fighting? (For example, stay in the room, go to an older sibling, leave or hide, ask parents to stop, call someone, run out, get someone to help?)” 2) “When your mom and dad (or name of paramour) are fighting, what do you worry about the most?” 3) “Have you ever talked to any other grown-ups about your mom and dad (or name of paramour) fighting?” ii) These questions for children are not all-inclusive. Each question may require or lead to additional, follow-up questioning. iii) The Child Protection Specialist should consider requesting the assistance of the local Child Advocacy Center (CAC) to interview children in investigations where there is chronic violence in the home and parents have failed in the past to cooperate with services.

Children may externalize or internalize trauma. There is no single indicator to determine abuse. For instance, a child that does not flinch when the alleged abuser raises their hand or who appears to love an alleged abuser is not an indicator that the child has not been abused. Similarly, the fact that an alleged adult victim seems to be comfortable speaking in front of the alleged abuser is not an indicator of absence of domestic violence in the home. ii) When assessing the level of risk to the children, the Child Protection Specialist should consider whether there is reasonable cause to believe: a) There is ongoing domestic violence and/or that the alleged perpetrator has a history of domestic violence; b) The children have been or are likely to be used as a shield, or held or physically restrained from leaving during an incident of domestic violence; c) The children will be placed at substantial risk of harm should they attempt to intervene during an incident of domestic violence; d) The alleged perpetrator has committed assault or murder and has threatened to harm members of the immediate family, extended family and/or pets; e) The ability of the child or children to function on a daily basis has been substantially impaired due to incidents of domestic violence; f) The non-offending caregiver or alleged perpetrator describe the children in negative terms, act negatively towards the children or blame them for the incidents of domestic violence; and/or g) The alleged batterer has used or has threatened to use weapons in an act of violence. h) The domestic violence in the family is directly compromising the adult victim’s ability to protect the children.

These are the people who interact most frequently with families and may hear or see signs and symptoms of domestic violence as well as child abuse or neglect. Additionally, they may receive disclosures directly from the family prior to DCFS involvement in an attempt to receive some form of support or assistance. Questions used to gather information from adult victims can be adapted for inquiries with collateral contacts. g) Clinical Services Support 1) Child Protection Specialists should consult with a Clinical Domestic Violence Specialist in the Division of Clinical Services’ Domestic Violence Intervention Program when an investigation involves one or more of the following dynamics during an incident of intimate partner violence.

A) Illinois Domestic Violence Help Line: 1-877-TO-END-DV (1-877-863- 6338) B) Chicago Metropolitan Battered Women’s Network: 312-750-0730 C) Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence: 217-789-2830 D) National Teen Dating Violence Help Line: 866-331-9474 h) Staff Safety Learning to identify dangerous behavior and planning for self-protection is crucial when working with persons involved in domestic violence situations or other circumstances involving violence. The goal of identifying staff safety guidelines is so that child protection/welfare professionals are able to plan for safe contact with families that have experienced violence, and to further support safety plans for children that have been abused and/or neglected. Child Protection Specialists will need to use extreme caution when intervening on behalf of a family. Department involvement may increase the risk to both the family and Child Protection Specialist; a batterer may feel that the presence of an outsider (the Child Protection Specialist) threatens their level of control over others. 1) Child Protection Specialists should carefully consider the following guidelines if domestic violence is reported or suspected in an assigned investigation: A) Consult with the Child Protection Supervisor about staff safety concerns; B) When doing an assessment or interviews with the family, be aware of triggers of violence; and C) Consider how the perpetrator’s LEADS history could impact staff safety.

Take caution when meeting with the batterer alone. A) When the alleged perpetrator has a violent criminal history, the Child Protection Specialist should involve local law enforcement to assist in conducting the interview; and B) Assess the surroundings and create and maintain an exit strategy. 3) Certain situations can trigger violence in batterers. The Child Protection Specialist should be ALERT to the following circumstances: A) Adult victim is preparing to leave (e.g., shelter, order of protection, separation or divorce); B) Children are going to be removed; C) Batterer has just been released from jail or is facing serious criminal charges and possible incarceration; D) Allegations are made directly to the batterer regarding either domestic violence or child abuse and neglect; or E) Batterer is requesting or demanding information regarding the family’s location after a separation. 4) Child Protection Specialists should remember to: A) Trust their instincts; B) Stay calm; C) Know that the batterer will try to test the Child Protection Specialist’s limits; and D) Do not to engage in confrontation.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_104_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT June 6, 2022 – P.T. 2022.03 i) Documentation A) Information obtained from required domestic violence interviews, collateral contacts, as well as information relevant to safety assessment and protective actions must be documented in investigation interview notes and the initial and any subsequent CFS 1441, Safety Determination Form when evidence or circumstances suggest that a child’s safety may be in jeopardy. B) When significant indicators of domestic violence exist, the Child Protection Specialist may offer a domestic violence brochure to the adult who is a possible victim of domestic violence, whether or not the level of risk to the child warrants any further involvement. The Child Protection Specialist should determine with the adult victim if it is safe for him/her to receive and retain this brochure. In some cases, the adult victim may state that it is not safe for him/her to keep the brochure. In such cases, the Child Protection Specialist can review the brochure with the adult victim and discuss the content, rather than leaving it with him/her. The brochure used for this purpose is the CFS 1050-85, You and Your Children Have a Right to be Safe From Abuse: What You Need To Know About Domestic Violence And Child Welfare. The CFS 1050-85-S is the Spanish translation version. The Child Protection Specialist shall consult with the Department’s Clinical Domestic Violence Specialists for further guidance and clinical support concerning reports involving domestic violence. C) The Child Protection Specialist should help the children and adult victim develop an emergency plan for where to go (e.g., another room or a neighbor’s house) if there is domestic violence, and how to access help. D) Child Protection Specialists should identify whether a Domestic Violence Shelter is a safe and viable option for the adult and child victims. Information on shelter vacancies can be readily accessed by calling the 24-hour Illinois Domestic Violence Helpline: 877-863-6338. E) If the caregiver is unable to demonstrate a capacity to protect the children in the home, and/or the presence of domestic violence creates safety and risk factors that compromise the children’s safety, the children should be taken into protective custody. F) All of these interactions should be documented in the electronic case record and in any hardcopies, especially all forms, with signatures, initials or acknowledgments of referrals or acceptance of services. Be sure to document when caregivers refuse or deny services. All communication between the worker and the family experiencing domestic violence or suspected domestic violence should be thoroughly documented. All documentation should be clear and concise. If referrals are made, document the agency, location, whether a contact person was identified and any scheduled appointments. Document all calls that are made with the family to community providers. Include the family members response to the referrals, note where family members are agreeable, reluctant or ambivalent. These all help to shape the rationale for investigative outcomes and determinations.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_105_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT December 14, 2011 – P.T. 2011.30 APPENDIX K - INFANT SAFE SLEEP PRACTICES a) Purpose Improvements in the number and quality of death scene investigations, caregiver interviews and research data collection provide better information about infant deaths including those formerly referred to as “rollovers.” Unexplained infant deaths labeled SIDS about a decade ago are now referred to as Sudden Unexplained Infant Death Syndrome (SUIDS). SUIDS includes deaths attributed to Accidental Suffocation and Strangulation in Bed (ASSB), SIDS, and unknown causes. Many of these deaths can be directly attributed to unsafe sleeping conditions. The purpose of this protocol is to establish uniform procedures for investigating families when an SUIDS death is suspected. b) Definitions “AAP” means the American Academy of Pediatrics. “Accidental Suffocation and Strangulation in Bed (ASSB),” a subset of SUID, is a leading category of injury-related infant deaths. Although evidence suggests that the rate of ASSB is increasing (Shapiro Mendoza, et al, 2006) ASSB deaths are potentially preventable. “Asphyxia” means a lack of oxygen in the blood due to restricted respiration that, if severe enough and prolonged, causes death. “Bed Sharing” means when another person, most often a parent or sibling, shares a sleep surface with an infant. “Co-Sleeping” means a more general term than bed sharing. It can mean bed sharing or sleeping in close proximity to the infant (i.e., adult sleeping in bed with infant sleeping in safe crib in same room). “Entrapment” means when an infant is stuck in a position in which they cannot get out. An example is when an infant is caught between an adult and the back of a couch/sofa or under the cushions, thereof. “Intoxicated” refers to impaired capacity to attend to the needs of infant or child due to the influence of a mood-altering substance such as drugs or alcohol. Drugs may be prescription, over-the-counter or illegal. “Loose Bedding” includes bed items such as cushions, pillows, comforters, blankets, quilts, bumper pads, stuffed animals, cords, positioners, wedges, etc. “Overlay” means a type of unintentional suffocation that occurs when something covers an infant or someone rolls over onto the infant. Appendix K – Procedures 300",506,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_106_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT December 14, 2011 – P.T. 2011.30 “Prone” means lying on the stomach. “Sleep-Related Deaths” include sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), unintentional suffocation in bed and/or the cause listed as undetermined but the infant died during sleep. “Soft Bedding” includes adult mattresses, comforters, cushions, pillows, quilts, sheepskins, etc. “Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)” means the sudden death of an infant less than one year of age that cannot be explained after a thorough investigation is conducted, including a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history. (Center for Disease Control) “Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Syndrome (SUID),” also known as sudden unexplained infant death, means the sudden and unexpected death of an infant in which the manner and cause of death are not immediately obvious prior to investigation. SUID can be caused by metabolic disorders, hypothermia or hyperthermia, neglect or homicide, poisoning, or accidental suffocation. Some SUIDs are attributed to SIDS and sometimes the cause is unexplained. “Suffocation” means restriction of access to air or oxygen that can cause death. “Supine” means lying on the back. “Unintentional Suffocation” means a manner of death that occurs when loose materials or soft bedding block or cover the infant’s external airway. “Wedging” means compression of the face or thorax against objects, as when an infant is trapped between a wall and mattress, caught in cushions of a sofa or chair, etc. c) Background SIDS remains the number one cause of post neonatal (age 1 month to 1 year) infant death. Approximately 90-95% of infants who die from SIDS have died by the age of 6 months with approximately 60% of deaths occurring in the 2 – 4 month age range. Approximately 60% of the deaths occur in males as opposed to 40% of deaths in females. Consistently higher rates are found in African American and Native American populations (2 to 3 times the national average). Among Hispanic subgroups, infant mortality rates ranged from 4.52 per 1000 live births for Central and South American mothers to 8.01 per 1000 live births to Puerto Rican mothers. (Mathews et al, 2011) Appendix K – Procedures 300",512,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_107_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT December 14, 2011 – P.T. 2011.30 The cause of SUIDS has not been determined, but there are common factors known to contribute to an increased risk of sudden unexplained infants deaths. These include:  Infant sleeping in prone position;  Use of soft or loose bedding (bumper pads, quilts, comforters, pillows, etc.);  Unsafe sleeping environments (adult beds, couches, daybeds, waterbeds, etc.);  Overheating due to high room temperature, excess clothing and blankets, and/or, head or face covered during sleep;  Mother’s age younger than 20 years;  Mother smoking during pregnancy;  Exposure to secondhand smoke;  Mother receiving late or no prenatal care;  Premature birth or low birth weight; and  Mother’s use of drugs or alcohol during pregnancy. Large-scale epidemiologic studies by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have shown that high risk situations like maternal obesity, smoking, alcohol, drug use, overcrowding and the use of non-bed sharing surfaces like couches and chairs may increase the risk of accidental suffocation. Many of these contexts are particularly prevalent in urban poor families. Although researchers do not yet know how to predict or prevent SIDS, accidental deaths due to suffocation, entrapment or overlay can be prevented by following safe sleep techniques. Staff serving families with infants and young children must take the time to educate parents and caregivers about safe sleeping principles and dangers of co-sleeping. All direct service staff must ensure parents and caregivers are aware that an infant sleeps safest on his/her back in a separate sleep arrangement (e.g., crib, bassinet, portable play pen, etc.) that is free of objects that may pose an asphyxiation threat (pillows, large stuffed animals, thick blankets, cords, etc). NOTE: If the family cannot afford safe/separate sleep items (bassinet, crib, playpen, etc.), DCFS will either provide one from current supply or purchase the article with Norman Funds. Appendix K – Procedures 300",445,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_108_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT December 14, 2011 – P.T. 2011.30 It is extremely important to discuss safe sleeping practices with the family even if a separate sleep area for the child is available in the home. A 2003 study of 102 accidental infant asphyxia deaths conducted by the Maryland Office of Chief Medical Examiner concluded that a crib was available in the home for 9 out of 10 asphyxiated co-sleeping deaths. The following Safe Sleep practices from the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) must be shared and discussed with parents/caregivers:  Always place your baby in his or her separate sleep area on his or her back to sleep, for naps, and at night. The back sleep position is the safest, and every sleep time counts.  Place your baby on a firm sleep surface, such as on a safety-approved crib mattress, covered by a fitted sheet. Never place your baby to sleep on pillows, quilts, sheepskins, and other soft surfaces.  Keep soft objects, toys, and loose bedding out of your baby's sleep area. Don't use pillows, blankets, quilts, sheepskins, and pillow-like crib bumpers in your baby's sleep area, and keep any other items away from your baby's face.  Do not allow smoking around your baby. Don't smoke before or after the birth of your baby, and don't let others smoke around your baby.  Keep your baby's sleep area close to, but separate from, where you and others sleep. Your baby should always sleep in a safe crib, bassinet, or portable play yard. Baby should never bed-share with anyone, and baby should not be put to sleep on non-bed surfaces like couches and chairs. Baby can sleep in the same room as caregiver, and it is alright to bring baby to bed for nursing, feeding, play and cuddle time. However, baby must be placed back into the crib, bassinet, or portable play yard for safe sleep.  Think about using a clean, dry pacifier when placing the infant down to sleep, but don't force the baby to take it. (If you are breastfeeding your baby, wait until your child is one month old or is used to breastfeeding before using a pacifier.)  Do not let your baby overheat during sleep. Baby needs the same number of layers as the adult caregiver plus one thin layer for sleep. Baby’s head or face should never be covered during sleep.  Avoid products that claim to reduce the risk of SIDS because most have not been tested for effectiveness or safety. Appendix K – Procedures 300",555,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_109_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT December 14, 2011 – P.T. 2011.30  Do not use home monitors to reduce the risk of SIDS. If you have questions about using monitors for other conditions talk to your health care provider.  Reduce the chance that flat spots will develop on your baby's head: provide ""Tummy Time"" when your baby is awake and someone is watching; change the direction that your baby lies in the crib from one week to the next; and avoid too much time in car seats, carriers, and bouncers. d) Investigation and Intact Specialist Responsibilities 1) Investigations Investigation Specialists are generally first responders to a family based upon a hotline report. The Specialist shall educate parents/caregivers about environmental threats to child safety and ensure safe sleeping arrangements as soon as possible after initiation. Specialists must ensure sleeping arrangements for all household children whether or not they are listed as primary victims. Safe sleep discussions and plans for the infant must occur if the mother and/or any household female is confirmed or suspected to be pregnant. The Specialist shall inspect for environmental threats and safe sleeping arrangements for each residence in which a family moves during an active investigation. In family households (non-licensed facilities) where safe sleeping arrangements are insufficient or nonexistent, the Investigation Specialist must take immediate action to specifically address and resolve the safety threat prior to leaving the family’s home. It is unsatisfactory to merely document the insufficient or nonexistent sleeping arrangements on the Home Safety Checklist, provide the “Safe Sleeping for Your Baby” brochure and tell the mother/caregiver not to sleep with the infant. The Specialist shall call the supervisor or manager to discuss protective strategies up to and possibly including immediate provision of a crib, bassinet, portable play yard, etc. The Specialist shall not leave the family’s home until implementing the safe sleeping solution determined or recommended in consultation with the supervisor or manager (see Section 3 of these procedures, Safe Sleep Strategies). 2) Intact Family Services If a case is opened to intact family services, the Intact Specialist shall periodically monitor sleeping arrangements for all involved children. Safe sleeping plans for the infant must be discussed if the mother and/or any household female is confirmed or suspected to be pregnant. Any changes in household composition or location shall require immediate assessment of sleeping arrangements and completion of the Home Safety Checklist. The Specialist shall call the supervisor or manager to discuss protective strategies up to and including Appendix K – Procedures 300",501,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf

Investigation and Intact Specialists must recognize increased threats to safe sleeping where one or both parents/caregivers appear intoxicated. In some cases, over-the-counter and prescription medication can increase inability to safely care for infants and young children. . NOTE: If the household composition contains a child with developmental equivalency to an infant, the Specialist shall discuss safe sleeping arrangements with the parent or caregiver. The Specialist shall ask and document the doctors, therapists, etc. involved with the child and any discussions of safe sleeping they have had with the parents. In households where safe sleeping arrangements are insufficient or nonexistent, Specialists must take immediate action to specifically address and resolve the safety threat prior to leaving the family’s home. For circumstances in which the developmentally delayed child is too large to be accommodated in a portable play yard, Norman Funds are appropriate for assistance. 3) Safe Sleep Strategies The purpose of helping the parents/caregivers devise safe sleeping solutions is to underscore the importance of educating them of the dangers of co-sleeping and/or sleeping on surfaces not approved for infants. Many families may already have separate safe sleep surfaces for their infant and may only need to be reminded of the dangers of co-sleeping and/or allowing the baby to sleep on a surface not approved for infants. While it may not be possible to immediately provide a portable crib for the infant’s family to use due to after hours/on-call assignment, distance from headquarters, etc, the Specialist and Supervisor must assess the family’s current situation and determine a timeframe no later than three business days based upon availability from supplies issued for investigations and intact families. If Norman funds need to be accessed, the referral must be submitted for processing the following business day after contact with the family with the target of five business days for the family to have a safe sleeping surface for their infant. However, an interim solution must be developed and documented with the family prior to the Specialist leaving the home.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_111_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT December 14, 2011 – P.T. 2011.30 The safe sleep solution determined in consultation with the Supervisor is a critical decision and must consider several factors:  Immediate availability of an appropriate bed or crib;  Prior involvement with the family during which infant safe sleep practices were discussed;  History of parent/caregiver’s substance misuse;  Condition of the home. Homes that are cluttered, chaotic, in disarray or environmentally hazardous provide additional safety threats that might compromise temporary safe sleep solutions and require other critical decisions;  Presence of small children and/or pets that might have access to the infant depending upon the strategy implemented.; and  Parents/caregivers’ understanding and willingness to cooperate with temporary solutions and ensure information is discussed with infant’s substitute caretakers. Temporary safe sleeping arrangements may vary depending upon capacity of parents/caregiver, available resources, safety decision, etc. Ultimately, the primary (or after hours) supervisor or manager will have to immediately approve the temporary safe sleeping arrangements or ensure delivery of a portable crib is expedited. In areas of limited cell phone reception (generally rural areas), the supervisor must review and approve the temporary sleep solution with the same expediency as approval for protective custodies. The following may or may not be appropriate for every family and are offered for guidance only. Possible temporary safe sleep solutions might include, although are not limited to:  An opened container-type item large enough and structurally sound enough for the infant. This might include an empty drawer removed from the dresser, a low-sided box with bottom and all sides secured, etc. Only light-weight (baby) blankets should be used, if parents/caregivers insist some sort of cushion is needed. However, no pillows, thick blankets, stuffed animals, thick clothing, other bedding etc, should be used;  A safe firm low surface (floor) out of the path of foot traffic—not situated immediately to the side of parents/caregivers’ bed where infant could be stepped upon and away from small children and animals;  A pallet on the floor with light-weight blankets;  An uncluttered area where nothing could fall into the sleep area on top of the infant restricting breathing;  Parents/caregivers should be cautioned against sleeping with the infant on a couch, easy chair, etc, as these are not an acceptable temporary solution.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_112_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT December 14, 2011 – P.T. 2011.30 Any decision to take temporary protective custody must include imminent threats to the infant’s safety and the totality of the family’s situation (allegations, prior history, dynamics, etc). The absence of a safe separate infant sleep surface in and of itself is not sufficient for protective custody but requires immediate documented protective action. e) Death Investigations Due to Unsafe Sleeping Arrangements Research findings conclude unsafe sleep arrangements are a highly significant risk factor associated with SUID. Good practice requires a thorough and competent death scene investigation and scene re-creation. The scene re-creation will demonstrate the presence of unsafe bedding, sleeping conditions, and/or positioning of the infant that resulted in unintentional suffocation or presented an environmental challenge that may have contributed to the death. Procedures 300 requires a scene investigation for many allegations and for most death investigations, law enforcement is immediately involved. However, there are situations in which the law enforcement investigation may be suspended if their assessment is accidental lay over. If law enforcement is involved, the Investigation Specialist should ask if the scene investigation has occurred and have the results shared with DCP. If the scene investigation has not taken place, the Specialist must immediately ask if doing so compromises the law enforcement investigation. Once cleared to proceed, or if informed law enforcement indicates they will not do so, the Investigation Specialist must complete the scene investigation immediately. All discussions with law enforcement about the scene investigation and/or any aspects of the investigation must be immediately and carefully documented. The Specialist shall obtain a detailed description of events surrounding the infant’s death. A scene investigation shall include, but is not limited to:  Environmental circumstances surrounding the incident (i.e., objects, times, and distances involved);  Events leading to the incident, including a 24-48 hour timeline of sequence of events leading to the incident;  Persons in the environment at the time of the incident;  Extended family members or other collaterals that have had contact with the infant and may have witnessed the incident;  General safety conditions of the home, including temperature of the room in which the death occurred (extremely hot or cold);  How the incident occurred (mock demonstration by the alleged perpetrator and other witnesses).

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_115_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 3, 2012 – P.T. 2012.07 APPENDIX L – FACTITIOUS DISORDER BY PROXY (MEDICAL CHILD ABUSE) a) Purpose The purpose of these procedures is to provide information about Factitious Disorder by Proxy (FDP), also referred to as Munchausen by Proxy (MBP) syndrome and more recently, Medical Child Abuse, and to provide guidelines for investigating reports of abuse and neglect when the child’s parent or caregiver is suspected of having this disorder. FDP is a complex form of child abuse requiring a carefully coordinated multidisciplinary approach. b) Definitions Factitious Disorder by Proxy  “Factitious” means not real, genuine, or natural. Factitious disorders are therefore characterized by physical or psychological symptoms that are intentionally produced or feigned.  “Proxy” means acting through a substitute or via another person. The following definitions and examples were adapted from Munchausen by Proxy (MBP) Maltreatment Manifesting as Child Sexual Abuse by Louisa J. Lasher, M.A. and Marc D. Feldman, M.D. “Feign” means that an intentionally false medical report of a child is made to professionals by the child’s parent. For example, a sleeping infant is reported to 911 to have been resuscitated by his or her parent after the parent allegedly found the infant not breathing and turning blue. “Exaggerate” means that a child’s medical condition is overstated by his or her parent. For example, a child has a low-grade fever (100.5º) that has lasted several days, and the child’s parent reports on multiple occasions to the pediatrician that the child’s temperature ranges between 103º and 105º. “Simulate” means that the child’s parent manufactures evidence of an illness and conceals his or her involvement in the deception. For example, the mother of an infant that is not ill places a substance that appears to be vomit next to the child and reports to the child’s father that the child has been throwing up. “Aggravate” means that a child’s pre-existing medical or psychological problem is worsened by his or her parent. For example, a child has juvenile diabetes mellitus that requires a daily injection of insulin administered by the parent. And the parent deliberately causes the child’s blood sugar level to rise by giving the child an incorrect dosage of insulin. Appendix L – Procedures 300",510,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_116_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 3, 2012 – P.T. 2012.07 “Induce” means that the parent deliberately causes the child’s medical problem. For example, the parent calls for help after he or she gives the child a substance to cause vomiting. “Symptom collusion” means a defense mechanism used by the victim to protect his or her family from outside forces. For example, an older child may consciously or unconsciously keep secrets about actual symptoms or illness to protect himself/herself or the family; and/or to preserve secondary benefits gained from the results of the symptoms or illness. c) Characteristics of FDP Factitious Disorder by Proxy (FDP) is a mental illness in which a person acts as if an individual he or she is caring for has a physical or mental illness when the person is either not actually ill or not as ill as reported. People suspected of FDP assume the role of a sick person indirectly by producing symptoms or lying about the health of a person under their care, usually a child under 6 years of age. This is not done to achieve a concrete benefit such as financial gain. People with FDP have an inner need for the child to be seen as ill or injured in order to garner sympathy and special attention given to people who are truly ill and/or the dedicated parents caring for them. FDP is a form a child abuse that occurs in all-racial and socio-economic groups. Note: Factitious disorders are considered mental illnesses because they are associated with severe emotional difficulties. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Forth Edition (DSM-IV) The following characteristics are common in persons with FDP.  The perpetrator often is a parent, usually the mother;  The perpetrator might be a health care professional or has had some type of medical training;  If married, the spousal relationship is usually shallow;  The perpetrator is very friendly and cooperative with health care providers;  The perpetrator appears quite concerned about the child, but may have a hostile, difficult and demanding personality outside a medical setting;  The perpetrator may have a tendency toward self-dramatization or incessant need for attention.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_117_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 3, 2012 – P.T. 2012.07 d) Effects of FDP This disorder can lead to short-term and long-term complications that include continued abuse, life threatening events, multiple hospitalizations, and the death of the child victim. Warning signs of FDP include the following:  The child has a history of many hospitalizations, often with a strange set of symptoms;  Worsening of the child’s symptoms generally is reported by the mother and is not witnessed by hospital staff;  Representation of the child’s condition and symptoms that do not agree with the results of the diagnostic tests (e.g., induced symptoms vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, infections, bleeding, central nervous system depression, and fever);  There might be more than one unusual illness or death of children in the family (e.g., miscalculates the smothering of the child or gives the child too much medication);  Blood samples found in the child’s urine or stool specimens might not match the blood of the child;  There might be signs of chemicals in the child’s blood, stool, or urine (e.g., potassium, acetaminophen, aspirin, insulin, prescription medication, diuretics, illicit drugs, arsenic, noxious substance, and other toxic substances);  The child’s reported condition improves in the hospital, but symptoms recur when the child returns home. e) Investigation Process Factitious Disorder by Proxy/Munchausen syndrome by proxy has not been assigned an allegation number as part of the Department’s allegation system. When FDP is reported by a medical professional and the information provided does not meet the criteria for an existing allegation, the SCR will take the report and assign Allegation #10/60, Substantial Risk of Physical Injury. In cases where FDP has been confirmed by medical personnel (i.e., physician, psychiatrist, psychologist) the first concern is to ensure the safety and protection of the victim and potential victims. Managing a case involving FDP often requires a team that includes social workers, foster care, law enforcement, and health care workers.

procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_118_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 3, 2012 – P.T. 2012.07 Most incidents of suspected FDP are based solely on circumstantial evidence. The combination of the unique type of evidence gathering and criminal properties of the disorder require a multidisciplinary approach and cooperation between agencies to avoid error or loss of potential evidence. Required documentation for investigations where FDP is suspected includes the following:  Interview all persons that suspect the alleged perpetrator of FDP. Document on a SACWIS Contact Note each person’s qualifications, the basis of the facts leading to their suspicion of FDP, and the impact on the alleged child victim’s health;  Obtain the medical histories for the alleged child victim and his or her siblings; names of all the treating physicians; hospital admissions and dates; presenting symptoms; medical procedures performed; and medications given to the child since birth. Attempts should be made to obtain this information from the child’s parents;  Names of all living and deceased siblings of the alleged child victim. Document the reported cause of death for all deceased siblings. If any of the deaths were attributed to SUIDS or undetermined, identify the city, county, state and dates of the deaths;  Complete a non-rushed medical records review of all the children in the home, and case conference with as many previous treating physicians as possible. This should be completed in conjunction with the activities of the multidisciplinary team if one has been formed or through a consulting physician coordinated by a Department nurse. Care should be taken to document the following questions related to symptoms. The information will often strongly suggest that the lack of clinical-sense of the case is not resulting from some medical problem in the child; i) If the symptoms are suspected of being induced, how were they induced? ii) If the symptoms were chemically induced, how long would it take for the symptoms to appear after the administration of the chemical, and how long would these last? iii) What was the circumstance of the onset of the symptoms? iv) Who was present prior to the onset of the symptoms? v) Do the medical records of siblings contain evidence of false pediatric reporting?  Assess the alleged perpetrator’s medical and physiological histories;  Identify all persons that have access to the child or care for the child (e.g., teachers, babysitters, relatives, co-workers, previous spouses, paramours, clergy, etc); Appendix L – Procedures 300",500,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_119_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 3, 2012 – P.T. 2012.07  Identify all prescription and non-prescription medication in the child’s home. Also document the name of the prescribing physician and dosage instructions. This should be completed for each location where the child has been if it is believed that the child was medicated at another location;  Make a referral to law enforcement and the State’s Attorney;  Complete a 24 to 72 hour timeline of events prior to the most recent hospitalization of the child victim. The timeline must identify who was in the household; activities and family behaviors; persons who cared for the child and their mood; the child’s routine (i.e., eating, sleeping and awake patterns); and the child’s fussiness or crying. This will assist the Investigation Specialist in identifying the stress or risk factors present prior to the most recent incident;  Complete a scene investigation that documents the environmental circumstances surrounding the incident; location of objects, implements, medications, chemicals near the child’s location; assessment of any children at the location that would be able to access the afore-mentioned items; areas occupied by the child and items contained in that space; general safety conditions of the child’s home; and other activities directed by the Investigation Supervisor or case circumstances. f) Required Contacts and Activities In addition to the established investigative requirements for the allegation or allegations identified in the SACWIS Intake, the Investigation Specialist must do the following upon notification that FDP is suspected:  Immediately contact with the Department’s Medical Director to discuss the investigation, information to date and planned activities. It may be necessary to have frequent communication with the Medical Director as information becomes available. Consultation must also occur prior to entering the final finding;  Contact Department nursing staff and schedule a meeting to discuss the case. Use the assigned Department nurse to interpret medical terminology and medical documents. The nurse must also be included in multidisciplinary meetings. All contacts with the nurse must be documented on a SACWIS Contact Note;  Notify law enforcement within 24 hours and obtain copies of applicable police reports involving persons in the child’s home. See Procedures 300.50 if law enforcement will take the lead in the investigation;  Schedule a multidisciplinary team meeting with involved medical staffs, law enforcement and other team members to address immediate concerns for the child victim’s safety, evaluation of case information, and the methods for the development of the necessary evidence to confirm FDP; Appendix L – Procedures 300",518,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l.pdf
procedures-300-appendix-c-to-l_120_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT May 3, 2012 – P.T. 2012.07 NOTE: The existence of one or more physicians who may actively support the suspected parent or who hold a unique medical theory about the child’s condition that does not coincide with other physicians treating the family should not be reason to suspend investigative activities or determine there is no merit to suspicions of FDP. In many situations, parents who practice this form of abuse are effective at securing allies or finding doctors vulnerable to their deceptions or willing to entertain improbable theories rather than accept the possibility of intentional deception. Thus, professional opinions of child abuse experts on hospitals’ Child Protection Teams must be given more credence than primary care physicians.  Complete in-person and individual interviews with all the children in the alleged perpetrator’s household;  Complete in-person and individual interviews with all adults in the child victim’s home. If the alleged perpetrator is not a member of the child’s household, complete in-person and individual interviews with all adults and children in the perpetrator’s household. g) Protection of the Child Victim and Siblings When FDP is suspected, assessing the safety of the child victim requires coordination with the multidisciplinary team. If the alleged child victim is hospitalized, an assessment needs to be made concerning whether to limit, deny or monitor the alleged perpetrator’s contact with the child. Persons monitoring parents’ visits with the child must actively listen to conversations with the child and must never leave the child unsupervised with the parent. Observation notes should become part of the child’s hospital record. The Investigation Specialist must also obtain a copy of the observation notes for the investigative file. If available and deemed appropriate by the hospital, covert video surveillance of persons visiting the child should be conducted. Note: Evidence that is needed to demonstrate the alleged perpetrator’s hand, aside from careful laboratory documentation, can often be garnered from a “separation test” that demonstrates that the child is free of disease outside the care of the perpetrator. Although covert video surveillance of persons suspected of FDP is highly effective in exposing fraud, it may also be considered grounds for a lawsuit on grounds of entrapment. Prior to initiating an out-of-home safety plan, a thorough assessment of the relatives must be completed due to the fact that the parent often convinces the relatives of the legitimacy of the child’s symptoms, and that the parent is devoted and caring. The safety plan must have a well-constructed monitoring component. The Investigation Supervisor is responsible for ensuring that staff complies with the monitoring requirements of the safety plan.

When the suspicion of FDP is developed during the course of an investigation, the Investigation Supervisor and Manager must assess the merit of transferring the case to an Investigation Advanced Specialist. Upon notification that a case involves FDP, the Investigation Supervisor will immediately notify the Investigation Manager. The Investigation Supervisor must also conduct formal in-person supervision sessions with the assigned Investigation Specialist on a weekly basis, or more frequently if directed by the Investigation Manager. Supervision sessions must include discussions concerning investigation-specific information; safety plan monitoring; multidisciplinary team meetings; coordination and comparison of investigation information; and other information as determined by the Investigation Supervisor. The assigned Investigation Specialist must refer the case to the State’s Attorney. The screening packet provided to the State’s Attorney must include available medical records for the alleged victim and his or her siblings, and copies of all required investigative activities and contacts. When action is not taken by the State’s Attorney, or temporary custody is not granted, the Investigation Specialist must offer the family intact family services.

Smith, Acting Director EFFECTIVE: Immediately I. PURPOSE The purpose of this model guide is to inform staff and mandated reporters of changes pursuant to Public Act 101-0564 and Public Act 101-0237 which amend the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act and require amendments to Rules 300, Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect. These statutory changes are effective January 1, 2020. To the extent that any of the required activities in Section IV and V differ from Rules 300.20 and 300.30 or Procedures 300.15 and 300.30, this model Guide controls. Amendments to the Rules and Procedures 300 are being drafted and will be released in the near future. II. PRIMARY USERS DCFS Staff, POS Staff and Mandated Reporters III. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY Public Act 101-0564 redefines who is statutorily recognized as Mandated Reporters in the State of Illinois, and what is to be considered “a child known to them in their professional or official capacities”. It prescribes reporting requirements when there are two or more persons working together who share concerns about whether a child is abused or neglected and who else can make a report with reasonable cause. It also adds mandated reporter training frequency and requirements, including sources of training for mandated reporters and licensed practitioners and reporting of completed training. Public Act 101-0237 establishes that when a Mandated Reporter makes a report to the State Central Register and there is a prior indicated report of abuse or neglect or there is a prior open service case involving any member of the household that the Department must minimally accept a report as a child welfare services referral.

Desirable narratives should: • be brief and factual; • be easily read and understood; • flow logically and clearly; • describe the incident of harm and support the allegation; • clearly identify the roles of the subjects of the report; • keep the use of DCFS acronyms, jargon, or pronouns (e.g., he/she) to a minimum; • include detailed directions to rural locations; • use quotation marks for direct quotes of reporters or subjects; and • not contain extraneous information or editorial comments (i.e., the hotline worker’s own thoughts or perspective). Note: The Call Floor Worker (CFW) is required to document the current location of all subjects, if known. f) Supervisory Consultation Before requesting supervisory guidance or review when assessing or processing an intake, the CFW should perform required person searches and complete the intake prior to notifying the supervisor on duty of the need for consultation. Once a consultation is started with one Call Floor Supervisor, the CFW should make every effort to complete the consultation with the same supervisor. The Call Floor Supervisor on duty shall have final say in the assessment/processing of the intake.

(Additional information may be found in Procedures 300.30(h)(3), Related Information Report (RI.) Example: a child has been hospitalized for an extended period of time for serious head injuries that resulted in an indicated report and the child subsequently died as a result of the original injuries. Upon the death of the child, Allegation 1/51 shall be added in a Related Information (RI). The local Child Protection Services unit shall then obtain medical verification that the death was due to the original injury and not some other cause. iii) If the information assessed by the CFW does not qualify as a report of death by abuse or neglect, the CFW shall document the information as a SUID/Unusual Death and send the intake to the Call Floor Supervisor on duty for review. All death intakes automatically go to the supervisor for approval upon completion. Note: The CFW must immediately hand-deliver all death cases to the Call Floor Supervisor on duty and verbally inform the supervisor if a report has an emergency response code. (See Procedures 300.30 (f)(1) for report response codes) Note: For Southern Region ONLY: Once reviewed by the supervisor on duty, the CFW shall contact the appropriate Area Administrator and determine the need to consult with the Southern Illinois Child Death Investigation Task Force Commander about possibly sending out the Task Force to assist on the case.

The Call Floor Supervisor shall email the Death Intake to the SCR Administrator, SCR Assistant Administrator, and the Deputy Chief of Child Protection. • Redacted Indicated and Pending reports may be released to coroners/medical examiners, consulting physicians, law enforcement and Child Protection staff. Relevant information contained in Unfounded reports can also be shared with coroners/medical examiners, consulting physicians, law enforcement and Child Protection staff. • If a report of any allegation is pending, and the child dies, the CFW shall record the information as an RI and add Allegation 51 to the deceased child, if the cause of death is attributable to the pending allegation. • The existence of indicated prior reports of abuse or neglect for the family of a child who has died, does not automatically qualify a death as a report of death by abuse or neglect. Each case must be assessed individually based on the information available. • Either Allegation 1 or 51 may be assigned for each perpetrator of a child death, but no perpetrator may be assigned both allegations simultaneously. When two or more perpetrators are on one report, both Allegation 1 and 51 may be used. • Other children residing in the home, or who were being cared for in the home at the time of a child death, may be considered to be at risk of harm and assigned Allegation 10 Substantial Risk of Physical Injury and/or Allegation 60, Environment Injurious to Health and Welfare.

If SCR has information that indicates a parallel investigation is needed, the CFW shall assign case responsibility to the team where the child resides and assign parallel responsibility to the other RSF. If the report is taken after hours it must be called out to all involved counties, per the SCR after hours, on-call guidelines. When a report subject is located in another state, a parallel assignment is not required if the report is taken during regular business hours. If the report is taken after hours, the CFW is responsible to call the other state’s Child Protection Services and request that they initiate the report. If the out-of-state subject is the child victim and the initiation mandate has not been met, the CFW should include in the report narrative the phone number of the child protection services of the other state in order to assist the Child Protection Specialist in making arrangements for the mandate to be met. A) If the CFW accepts case responsibility on behalf of the State of Illinois for an investigation involving another state and the subject of the report in the other state is the child victim, the CFW is responsible to call and request the other state’s department of child protection services to initiate the investigation. The CFW shall note in the narrative that this call was made and document the number called and the name of the person with whom the CFW spoke. If the other state’s child protection service is unavailable (i.e., weekends, holidays, after hours), the CFW shall note their good faith attempt to contact them in the report narrative and include the other state’s child protection services contact information for the DCFS Child Protection Specialist. When a subject other than the victim is out of state, the CFW shall note the phone number for the other state’s Child Protective Services in the narrative and the Child Protection Specialist will request the parallel investigation when he/she has gathered enough information to make that request. B) When another state has accepted case responsibility for an investigation but one of the subjects is located in Illinois, the other state may call the Hotline and request a courtesy interview for child protection purposes. The CFW shall complete the intake as an Information Only (IO), noting in the first line of the narrative “Courtesy Interview.” The IO must be approved by the Call Floor Supervisor on duty and a copy of the intake must be printed. The CFW shall print, “Courtesy Interview” and the appropriate RSF across the top of the page.

If any one of the following criteria is present, check “Possible Media” on the decision tab and print a copy for the supervisor. • Children at home alone, especially very young children and/or several children; • Serious environmental neglect reports, especially if there is an open DCFS case; • Inadequate shelter reports that are taken because there is no heat in the home during periods of extreme cold; • Serious abuse to young children, especially if there are pending or indicated priors; • Any serious abuse to children in foster homes; • Any serious abuse to children placed with relatives by DCFS, whether or not the home is licensed; • Abandoned babies; or • Any case of serious harm or other serious situations involving a DCFS ward. 4) Facility Reports It is crucial that the CFW identify in any report of suspected abuse or neglect when the victim and/or perpetrator is a ward. The CFW shall ensure each case involving a ward is so identified. A facility report shall be taken when the alleged perpetrator of a report of suspected child abuse or neglect is a staff person in an institution, day care center, day care home, group home, foster home or school and is believed to have abused or neglected a child while acting in their professional capacity or a position of trust with the alleged victim. When the child’s relationship with a facility staff person comes from having a professional capacity or position of trust with the child, the staff person is considered an eligible perpetrator even if he/she is not acting in an official capacity at the time of the alleged abuse and/or neglect. The CFW shall process such reports per the instructions in Procedures 300.30(b), Multiple Perpetrators: When to Document as Single or Multiple Reports.

procedures-300_33_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 Examples of alleged perpetrators in facility reports include, but are not limited to: teachers, principals, child care staff, or other school personnel such as, bus drivers, janitors, or cafeteria staff. A) Multiple Perpetrators If there are indicated or pending prior reports on a facility, any new report must be a Subsequent Oral Report (SOR) to the corresponding facility SCR number, regardless whether the victims and/or staff perpetrators are not the same as prior reports. Facility report subjects may list only one alleged perpetrator per report sequence; however, reports involving foster homes are an exception and may list multiple perpetrators in a single report sequence. When a facility report involves more than one alleged perpetrator, an SOR should be added to the facility SCR number for each perpetrator. CFWs should reference in the report narrative when there are SOR(s) with additional perpetrators. There is no requirement for additional SORs when there are multiple child victims of one perpetrator documented in the same report. B) Coding the Report as a Facility All facility reports must be indicated as a facility by checking the facility box at the top of the intake. The CFW must ensure that the facility code and the relationship code agree and the report is linked to the correct facility. In cases where a facility has multiple locations, the CFW must match the address of the specific location with the address of the facility in the report. C) Group Homes and Child Care Facilities Residents of group homes and institutions are not eligible perpetrators to one another (child on child) unless one child is in a caretaker role. D) Foster Homes or Day Care Homes When a report alleging child abuse or neglect in a foster home or day care home is received, the CFW shall process the report in the same manner as institutions and day care centers, except the foster parent or day care home operator shall be the report’s case name. Children in foster homes may be perpetrators based on the same criteria as a report in a family home setting. If the caller’s information includes foster parent, foster home, foster child, adoptive parent, adoptive home, or DCFS ward, the CFW shall conduct a Provider Name Search and check for placements. Note: Linking anyone in a report who is coded as a “Provider” requires the intake to be processed as a facility report.

To qualify as a report of suspected abuse or neglect in this situation, the alleged perpetrator must be an employee of or a volunteer at the facility. This type of report is processed in the same manner as reports for youth under age 18. 5) DCFS/POS Employees and Other Sensitive Cases Reports alleging child abuse or neglect by DCFS or Purchase of Service (POS) agency employees, their relatives or other persons whose investigation may require sensitive handling must be brought to the attention of the Call Floor Supervisor on duty and approved before being sent to a field office for investigation. Supervisory approval is required whether or not the alleged perpetrator was acting in an official capacity at the time of the alleged abuse or neglect. The SCR Administrator in conjunction with the respective Regional Administrator shall the need to assign the report to a different RSF than the one that would normally be assigned in order to avoid a possible conflict of interest. Note: No employee report or other sensitive case may be transmitted without the approval of the SCR Administrator. 6) Possible Intentional False Reports A) Reading the False Report Notice If in the process of assessing a caller’s information for a report of child abuse or neglect the CFW determines the caller previously made a report that was retained as intentionally false, the CFW shall read to the caller the false reporting provision from ANCRA and ask if the caller wishes to proceed with their report. Any person who knowingly transmits a false report to the Department commits the offense of disorderly conduct under subsection (a)(7) of Section 26-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 . A violation of this provision is a Class 4 felony. [325 ILCS 5/4] If the reporter maintains he/she still wants to make a report after having been given the false report warning, and the information meets the criteria for a report according to Procedures 300.30(a)(2), the report shall be taken and transmitted to the appropriate RSF.

For additional information regarding the perpetrator’s right to have an unfounded report retained as intentionally false, refer to subpart C) of this subsection and Procedures 300.160, Notifications. ii) Retention of Intentionally False Reports Records of unfounded reports shall be retained for 5 years when the unfounded perpetrator of the report requests retention because he/she believes the report was an intentional false report. SCR shall document receipt of all requests for retention of records pursuant to this subsection. Child Protection Service teams shall maintain Intentional False reports in the local index file. When a Child Protection Specialist or Supervisor checks Factors Contributing to Unfounded Allegations ""Probable Intentional False"" in the Investigation Screen, the report shall be classified as an Intentional False Report and is coded as FS in the database. iii) Notification to the State’s Attorney In addition, SCR shall forward all of the information about intentional false reports to the State's Attorney in the county where the subject of the report was located. SCR shall request the local Child Protection Service unit forward a copy of the completed and approved investigation to the relevant local State's Attorney for consideration of criminal prosecution. Note: If the investigation reveals that the reporter placed the call from another county, the State’s Attorney in the county where the call was placed also has jurisdiction to pursue charges against the reporter. C) Reporter Notification Any time an unfounded report is retained as intentionally false, the Department is obligated to send written notification to the reporter. The written notice informs the reporter of their right to make a statement regarding the report being retained as an intentional false report. Any statement made by the reporter of an unfounded report that is retained as intentionally false shall be retained by SCR. For additional information regarding reporter notification, please refer to Procedures 300.160, Notifications.

procedures-300_36_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 7) Out of State Reports Occasionally SCR receives calls in which all of the subjects lived in Illinois at the time of an alleged incident, but have since moved to another state. Though the information may meet the criteria for a report of abuse/neglect, DCFS no longer has jurisdiction when the subjects are no longer Illinois residents. These situations may warrant an investigation by the child protection authorities of the subjects’ current state of residence, and that state may choose to do so based on the incident that occurred in Illinois or because the reported incident indicates an ongoing risk of harm to the child. It is also not unusual for SCR to receive calls that contain information that does not qualify as a report in Illinois, but may contain child protection issues that qualify in the other state. For additional clarification, staff should refer to the Guidelines for Assigning Case Responsibility grid in this subsection. In the above situation, the CFW should encourage the caller to contact the appropriate state directly, and give the caller the telephone number for the other state’s Child Protection Services. If the caller will not make a call to the other state, the CFW shall document the information in a MCNRT (mandated reporter) or an I & R (non-mandated reporter) and call the other state to make the report. CFWs must be sure to include in their documentation the date/time they make the call to the other state, the name and contact information of the out of state worker with whom they spoke, and whether the other state took a report. If there is need for an Illinois Child Protection Specialist to interview a subject for the other state’s investigation, the CFW shall give the out-of-state worker the phone number and supervisor’s name of the Illinois Child Protection team that would handle the interview. The CFW shall then complete the required documentation and processing of an Information Only to be sent to the Child Protection Supervisor of the appropriate RSF to arrange for a Courtesy Interview.

However, SCR will not take a report on a police officer who injures a youth in the process of apprehending and/or restraining the youth. CFWs should advise callers to contact the Chief of Police and/or the local State’s Attorney to report allegations of rough treatment by an officer or alleged “police brutality”. Any other allegations of child abuse/neglect involving a police officer in his/her professional capacity should be screened for a possible report. Chicago Police Officers as Perpetrators DCFS has an agreement with the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to inform them when a report lists a Chicago Police Officer as a suspected perpetrator, whether or not the alleged harm occurred in the line of duty or in private life. In the event such a report is taken, the CFW shall perform the usual steps in completing the report, including the CPD notification, and then call the CPD’s Youth Central (312-745-6004) and ask for the on-duty supervisor at Youth Division Headquarters. On weekends and holidays, the on-duty supervisor may not be on site; however, CPD staff will be able to direct the CFW to the on-duty supervisor. Once the CPD on-duty supervisor is reached, the CFW shall provide the supervisor with the details of the report. CPD notification shall be documented in the narrative and the report shall then be completed and processed as usual. 10) Law Enforcement Agency Data Systems (LEADS) Checks Law Enforcement Agency Data Systems (LEADS) checks are required for all child abuse or neglect reports and shall be requested for all subjects of the report who are age 13 and older. To obtain a LEADS check, the first and last name, gender and date of birth of the subject is required. When the required identifying information is not available, document “Insufficient information for LEADS check” at the bottom of the report narrative and process the report as usual. LEADS printouts mailed from SCR must be labeled, “LEADS printouts may not be disseminated beyond DCFS/POS Agencies.” 11) License Plate Checks The hotline frequently receives calls in which a child is observed being abused or neglected and the caller has no information about the subjects except for a license plate number. If the caller’s information meets the criteria for a report of suspected abuse or neglect, the CFW shall take a report making sure to fully and specifically document the incident that was observed and the location. The perpetrator(s) and the victim(s) shall be listed as “Unknown, Unknown” and as many identifying characteristics as possible (e.g., race, approximate age, gender, height, weight, description of the vehicle including color and make, etc.) shall be Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",617,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf

The CFW shall then call the Office of the Illinois Secretary of State (SOS) at 217-782-8841 or 217-782-8842, identify themselves, and request a license plate check. SOS staff will call back to the SCR supervisor’s desk with the license plate information and the supervisor shall forward the call to the requesting CFW. The CFW shall document in the report narrative the registration information received from the SOS, including the vehicle owner’s name and address, the license plate number, and the make, model and color of the car. The report shall then be assigned to the RSF where the vehicle is registered. CFWs must conduct a person search for the vehicle owner and list in the narrative any prior reports as “possible priors,” but do not add a SOR to any indicated prior reports on the vehicle owner. Child Protection staff will contact SCR for a SCR number consolidation, as needed, upon verifying the owner of the vehicle is the alleged perpetrator of the report. 12) Undocumented Persons Occasionally, calls to the hotline involve children who are undocumented residents living in Illinois. Legal status (American citizenship) is not addressed in ANCRA [325 ILCS 5] and is therefore not to be considered in any way as criteria for whether the hotline accepts a report for investigation. The CFW shall take a report of suspected child abuse or neglect or a referral for services that involves an undocumented child, when the criteria for taking a report or a referral is met. 13) Babies Born to Correctional Center Inmates For women incarcerated in DOC facilities who give birth, the CFW shall: A) Take a CWS dependency or child abuse or neglect report, whichever is appropriate; and B) Assign the CWS dependency to the RSF where the mother and baby are currently located or if a child abuse or neglect report is taken, assign the primary case responsibility to the RSF where the mother resided prior to incarceration and make a parallel assignment to the county where the hospital and baby are located.

In order to qualify for protection under the Abandoned Baby Protocol, the abandoned baby must be a newborn infant who: • has been left with personnel in a hospital, police station, fire station, or emergency medical facility; • a licensed physician reasonably believes is no more than 30 days old at the time of relinquishment; and • is not an abused or neglected child. Note: In order to meet the requirements of the Abandoned Baby Protocol, an infant must be left with personnel from one of the referenced facilities. Should the relinquishing person leave the infant without making arrangements with facility personnel to do so, they may qualify as a perpetrator in a report of child abuse or neglect. After the relinquishment of the infant to a fire station or emergency medical facility, the fire station or emergency medical facility's personnel must arrange for the transportation of the infant to the nearest hospital as soon as transportation can be arranged. Within 12 hours after accepting the infant, the accepting hospital must report to SCR for the purpose of transferring physical custody of the infant from the hospital to either a child-placing agency or the Department. A) Processing a Call Under the Abandoned Baby Protocol When a CFW receives a call of an abandoned baby that meets the above criteria, the CFW shall document the call as “Information Only” (IO) and state in the narrative that the mother gave up the infant under the “Safe Haven Law”. The completed IO shall be sent to the Call Floor Supervisor on duty for review and approval. The supervisor or supervisor’s designee shall contact a child-placing agency, which shall be selected on a rotating basis, to make the referral and then fax the IO to the accepting agency and authorize transfer of physical custody to that agency. If no child-placing agency is able to accept the infant during regular business hours, the IO shall be referred to the local DCFS Field Office serving the county where the infant was abandoned. Note: For after hours, holidays and weekends, the after-hours Child Protection Specialist on duty shall be notified of the IO. On the following business day after receiving the intake, the SCR Administrator shall request assistance from the Illinois State Police to determine that the infant is not listed as a missing child. The SCR Administrator shall then write a letter authorizing the adoption agency to accept physical custody of the infant and proceed with placement.

If an abandoned baby is more than 30 days old, the hospital and the Department must proceed as if the infant is an abandoned child, per Procedures 300, Appendix B, Allegation 75. 15) Post Adoption Notification When a report is taken and one or more alleged perpetrators are identified as receiving adoption assistance or subsidized guardianship, the CFW shall, via email, notify the assigned adoption/post adoption worker of the pending investigation. The notification shall contain the SCR number, and document that the alleged perpetrator is involved in an open adoption assistance or subsidized guardianship case. Copies of the notification shall be forwarded to the Post Adoption worker’s supervisor and the Area Administrator. 16) Illinois Child in St. Louis Area Hospitals Child Protection investigations involving Illinois children, who reside in Madison or St. Clair County and are admitted to a hospital in the city of St. Louis or St. Louis County, shall be handled by Illinois Child Protection Specialists only. Missouri Child Protection Services shall not be contacted to assist in the investigation. For children residing in counties other than Madison or St. Clair or for children who are not in a hospital in the city of St. Louis or St. Louis County, the assigned Illinois Child Protection Specialist shall contact Missouri Child Protection to request a child protection courtesy interview. Note: In either situation, CFWs are not to contact Missouri CPS. h) Non-Discrimination, Alternate Communication Needs and Cultural Awareness It is the model of the Department to provide services to all persons without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, ancestry, inability to speak or comprehend the English language, handicaps or age.

The following criteria must be met in order for a report of abuse or neglect to be taken: • The alleged child victim must be under 18 years of age or be between the ages of 18-22 while living in a DCFS licensed facility; • There must be an incident of harm or a set of circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to suspect that a child was abused or neglected as interpreted in the allegation definitions contained in Procedures 300, Appendix B; and • The person committing the action or failure to act must be an eligible perpetrator. For a report of suspected abuse, the alleged perpetrator must be the o child's parent, immediate family member, any individual who resides in the same home as the child, any person who is responsible for the child's welfare at the time of the incident, a paramour of the child's parent, or any person who came to know the child through an official capacity or is in a position of trust. For a report of suspected neglect, the alleged perpetrator must be the o child's parent or any other person who was responsible for care of the child at the time of the alleged neglect. Special Note Concerning Very Young Perpetrators: o ANCRA and Rule 300, Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect, do not set a minimum age for a perpetrator, with the exception of Allegation #10 Substantial Risk of Physical Injury, therefore any case involving a young perpetrator must be assessed on an individual basis according to the dynamics of the case. When assessing information regarding a very young perpetrator, the CFW shall seek supervisory consultation. Note: Lack of a complete address of residence or current location of the alleged child victim is never grounds for refusing to accept a report. In lieu of a full residential address, the following can be used to locate the subjects of Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",491,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf

If the CFW’s assessment of the caller's information does not qualify as a report of alleged child abuse or neglect, the CFW shall inform the caller that a report will not be taken. If the reporter is a mandated reporter, the decision that the caller’s information does not qualify as a report must have supervisory approval. The mandated reporter shall be told he/she may request to speak to a supervisor if the CFW does not accept the report and the mandated reporter wants to dispute that decision. 2) Information from the Reporter The Call Floor Worker (CFW) shall secure from the caller all information required to complete a report of suspected child abuse or neglect. Examples of information required for a report include, but are not limited to: • The identity, age, and location of the alleged child victim(s); • Directions to any rural route address, apartment numbers or other relevant information relevant to the location of the report subjects; • Demographics of the family including whether there is a non-custodial parent; • Identity of those who reside in the home and their relationship to the child victim, to include whether the alleged perpetrator is in a caretaker role. Document the location/residence/contact information of other subjects or involved parties who do not reside in the home; • What is the reporter’s basis for reasonable cause to believe a child has been abused or neglected, including the source of the reporter’s information; • Any information regarding substance use or misuse in the child’s home; • Any information regarding a history of domestic violence; • Whether any report subjects have a history of involvement with law enforcement; • Reporter information, when the reporter is mandated or non-mandated and willing to provide such information (e.g., contact information that includes an after-hours phone number, professional capacity or other relationship to alleged child victim, etc); • Any knowledge the reporter has regarding a current risk of harm to the child.

Threats to immediate safety must always be given highest priority. The CFW should consider the factors below when assessing alleged abuse/neglect of a child. The factors include, but are not limited to: Assessment Factors: • Age, gender, physical and mental abilities of the child; • The child’s ability to protect him/herself or seek a “safe haven”; • Severity of incident as well as location and type of injury; • Location of the alleged incident; • History of incidents, including frequency of incidents and approximate date of last known incident; • Believable threats made to the child by the alleged perpetrator, both current and past; • Whether the child is fearful; • Current location of the child; • Current location of the alleged perpetrator; Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",405,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf

If, during the assessment process, the CFW identifies safety threats in accordance with Procedures 300, Appendix G, CERAP, the safety threats must be documented in the intake narrative. Special Assessments in Cases of Egregious Acts The Department has identified certain acts of maltreatment deemed egregious that require a special assessment by the Office of Legal Services (OLS) and the Division of Clinical Practice and Professional Development. This special assessment will determine the need to by-pass reunification, seek a permanency goal other than reunification, and/or seek expedited termination of parental rights. If information identifying an egregious act is gathered at the time of the intake by SCR or during the course of the investigation, the report must be flagged as an egregious act case to alert the Child Protection Specialist and the Child Protection Supervisor that the case must be referred to OLS and Clinical. Call Floor Workers must document in the intake narrative that the report information contains an egregious act. Maltreatment is considered egregious if it is an egregious, sadistic, or torturous act that inflicts significant pain, causes extensive external and/or internal bruising, serious injury, or death.

procedures-300_47_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 Egregious acts include: • Perpetrator repeatedly thrown or slammed an infant or toddler against a hard surface using a strong degree of force creating a likelihood of abusive head trauma or multiple injuries including bruising or fractures over time. • Perpetrator caused abusive abdominal injuries, especially in very young children. • Perpetrator submerged and held a young child’s head under water or repeatedly submerged a child’s head creating a significant real or imminent risk of harm. • Perpetrator beat up or hit a child with an object using a degree of force that could be reasonably expected to cause serious injury or death. • Perpetrator attempted to or actually smothered, choked, strangled, or applied any other severe thoracic compression to a child. • Perpetrator extensively burned or scalded a child on purpose. • Perpetrator threatened or attached a child with a weapon, such as a knife, gun, or combustible substance. • Perpetrator took a child hostage. • Sadistic injury to a child. • Homicide of a child. • Non-accidental poisoning. b) Multiple Perpetrators: When to Document as Single or Multiple Reports When the caller identifies multiple perpetrators for a single incident of abuse/neglect, the CFW shall determine whether the alleged perpetrators reside in the child’s household, the address of incident, or other residence. When all alleged perpetrators are household members, the CFW shall list them in one report. When there are two independent families residing in the same household and both families are involved in the alleged abuse or neglect, then the CFW shall take two separate reports. When one or more alleged perpetrators reside in different locations, the CFW shall document in the narrative that an additional report will be added for each perpetrator. When the alleged perpetrator residing outside the home of the child victim has children in his/her own home and those children are known to have been abused or are considered to be at risk of physical or sexual injury or environment injurious, a report will be taken on those children. When abuse or neglect is alleged to have occurred in a facility and the caller identifies multiple perpetrators, the CFW shall document in the report narrative that a separate sequence shall be added to the facility SCR number for each perpetrator, as per Section 300.110(b), Child Abuse and Neglect in Child Care Facilities.

The CFW shall consult with the Call Floor Supervisor on duty whenever there is a question regarding an alleged harm rising to the level of possible criminal charges. Upon completion and supervisory approval, the CFW shall transmit the referral (IO) to the local DCFS field office to forward to the appropriate Child Advocacy Center. The CFW shall not personally contact the CAC to make the referral. If a service area does not have a CAC, the referral (IO) must be sent to the local DCFS field office to be given to local law enforcement. d) Law Enforcement Referrals When a CFW determines that law enforcement should be contacted regarding a call that does not qualify as a report, the CFW shall advise the caller to call the appropriate local law enforcement agency and offer to provide the caller with the phone number for that agency. The CFW shall not contact law enforcement if the caller refuses to contact law enforcement or to request a child welfare check, unless the CFW determines the child needs to be seen in order to assess immediate safety. e) Request for Quick Referral of Information Callers are sometimes in need of quick reference information, such as hotline numbers for other states, local DCFS office numbers, or general questions about the allegation system and DCFS. If time allows, the CFW monitoring incoming calls can provide such information, however the CFW should not spend significant time answering questions or providing information. For general questions about DCFS, callers should be referred to the DCFS website (www.DCFS.illinois.gov) or the local field office. All inquiries from the public or media regarding a specific case must be referred to the Office of Communications at 312-814- 6847. f) Report Response Codes There are 3 Response Codes possible for each report of suspected child abuse or neglect. Each Response Code has a required timeframe for the initiation of the report; however, the Action Needed Response Code requires clear and concise information for the response to be included in the report narrative. Each Response Code requires a Response Indicator to be selected in order to identify the basis for the Response Code. Response Codes and Response Indicators are listed and defined below: 1) Emergency Response means the Child Protection Specialist must immediately respond to the home or current location of the child; immediately means the Child Protection Specialist shall depart and be en route to the child’s home/location within 15 minutes of SCR transmitting the report to the field office or after-hours staff. The CFW must clearly support the reason for this response in the narrative of the report.

procedures-300_49_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 2) Action Needed. This Response Code is used for situations that require special handling but do not qualify as an emergency response. The CFW must give clear and concise information in the report narrative to support the “Action Needed” response. The Child Protection Specialist and Child Protection Supervisor are required to review the report within 60 minutes of SCR transmitting the report to the field office or after-hours staff in order to determine what action is necessary and to establish a time frame for the action. The Child Protection Supervisor makes the final determination after reviewing the report as to what actions are actually required. 3) Normal. Reports with a Normal response must be initiated within 24 hours. g) Response Indicators Each report of alleged child abuse or neglect has response indicators that provide the basis for an Emergency or Action Needed Response. The indicators and their required responses are as follows: • Child Death: Requires an Emergency Response. Note: If there are no surviving siblings or other children residing in the home, the Child Protection Supervisor must determine the current status of investigation activities by other law enforcement entities and determine the nature of the emergency response. • Family May Flee: The parent/caregiver intends to leave the home or move from the area to prevent Child Protection Services from having contact with the alleged child victim. Requires an Emergency Response. • Immediate Danger: The child is considered to be in immediate risk of being harmed and an Emergency Response is required. “Immediate danger” may mean the child is being assaulted as the caller makes the report; the child is in imminent danger • Reports from Hospital Staff Regarding Children 6 years and younger: SCR receives a report from hospital staff of injuries to a child ages 6 years and younger and there has been a previous report of serious injury involving any of the subjects of the pending report. Requires an Emergency Response. • Child Being Held by Police/Physician: Requires an Emergency Response. • Child Needs Immediate Medical Attention: The child’s health and well-being is considered to be at risk. Requires an Emergency Response. • Child Under 5 Alone/Unsupervised: A child too young to provide self-care is unsupervised. Requires an Emergency Response. The CFW should call local law enforcement for assistance, as needed.

procedures-300_50_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 • Child Alone/Unsupervised Age 5 and Older: This Indicator is for children age 5 and over who are alone now. An “Action Needed” response code may be required for this situation. The timeframe to initiate a report with this Indicator shall be based upon the ages of the children, time of day, location, and other safety threats identified in the narrative. If the Child Protection Specialist cannot initiate within this timeline, the Child Protection Specialist should notify the Child Protection Supervisor and call local law enforcement to request assistance. In Cook County, and during daytime hours downstate, the Child Protection Supervisor will establish a timeframe for initiation with the assigned Child Protection Specialist. In downstate regions after hours, this Indicator requires an immediate initiation or a call to the police for assistance in initiating. • Child at the Hospital with Perpetrator Present: The Child Protection Supervisor or designee shall contact the hospital within 60 minutes after receipt of the report to determine whether immediate initiation is necessary. An Action Needed response code is required for these situations, with the exception of reports regarding a substance affected infant. In the instance when the child victim is at a hospital with the alleged perpetrator present and the perpetrator is either interfering with treatment of the child, threatening to take the child against medical advice (AMA) or presents some other safety threat and emergency response must be applied. • None or Other: These Indicators should be used only for Normal or Action Needed Responses and when the Indicators listed above do not apply. h) Classification of Reports 1) Initial Oral Report (IOR) A report received at SCR involving subjects in a family unit with no pending or previously indicated reports or unfounded reports held on file as intentional false reports. Each IOR is assigned a new SCR identification number with an “A.” sequence. 2) Subsequent Oral Reports (SOR) A SOR is a report of a new incident of abuse or neglect involving the same family unit (i.e. one previously reported adult and at least one previously reported child) in a report that is pending, in “pending approval” status or retained as either indicated or intentionally false. In assigning a SOR, the same SCR number is used and a new letter sequence is added. Previously indicated perpetrators reported for abusing and/or neglecting children not previously listed in their prior reports, shall be assigned an SOR of their SCR number.

procedures-300_51_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 If a report is in “20-day hold” status, the CFW shall create an IOR. If a report is in “pending approval” status, the CFW shall create a SOR of that SCR number. SOR sequences sometimes appear to skip letters in the data base (e.g., skipping from “A” to “D”). The apparent disappearance of sequences is due to sequences (“B” and “C”) having been expunged. SCR numbers that complete all A to Z letter sequences will be assigned double-letter sequences, such as “AA” or “AB” when additional SORs are required. Note: Effort must be made to ensure facility reports are linked properly. When in doubt of a proper linkage of facility reports and subjects, the CFW should refer to Section 300.110(b), Child Abuse and Neglect in Child Care Facilities, or consult with the Call Floor Supervisor on duty. 3) Related Information Report (RI) If the information presented by the caller does not qualify as a new report of suspected child abuse or neglect, but there is a pending or undetermined investigation involving one of the subjects and the reporter’s information is related to the pending investigation, the CFW shall document the information in a RI. New or additional allegations may be added to a pending report via a RI, if the newly reported incident relates to the pending investigation. New subjects unrelated to the pending investigation should never be added to the investigation on the RI. Additional allegations or perpetrators shall not be added to a previously indicated report via an RI, except in death by abuse or neglect cases. Adding a death allegation to an indicated report: In death cases only, it is permissible to add allegations to an indicated report without taking a SOR. Example: A child has been hospitalized for ten months for serious head injuries that resulted from an indicated incident of abuse. Upon the death of the child, Allegation #1 should be added in a RI, if the child’s death is the result of the child’s original injury. Verification that the child’s original injury resulted in the child’s death must be provided by a medical examiner, pathologist, coroner, or by the treating physician. The CFW shall document the information in a RI intake, assign the new allegation, link the RI to the corresponding SCR number and sequence and transmit the RI to the applicable Child Protection unit within one hour of receipt. In doing so, the CFW shall also complete all other procedures for taking reports of Death by abuse or neglect. Note: Child Protection units shall notify the SCR if they determine that an RI report forwarded to them should have been taken as an SOR or an IOR.

A) The CFW shall perform the required person searches for all intakes. If there is an open case, document the information in an Information Only intake, print the supervisor approved IO, write “Attn: (caseworker’s name)” and the worker’s RSF on the top of the printed intake, scan and then email the completed IO to the caseworker. B) An IO can be appropriate when an investigation is completed, but is on a 20-day hold as SACWIS will not allow an RI to be completed for investigations on 20-day hold. An IO for this purpose should be forwarded to the attention of the Child Protection Supervisor of the applicable RSF. C) The CFW shall generate an IO in order to create a CAC referral when the caller attempts to make a report of sexual abuse or sexual assault but the perpetrator is not eligible. After documenting the caller’s information and supervisory approval, the IO must be printed, at the top of the page cross off “Information Only” and write “CAC referral” across the top of the page. The IO is now ready to fax to the appropriate RSF. If a service area does not have a CAC, the referral (IO) must be sent to the local DCFS field office to be given to local law enforcement. D) Requests for child protection courtesy interviews are completed as IOs. Such requests are completed when a child protection services agency from another state requests the Department’s assistance for one of their cases. Courtesy interviews usually involve one or more subjects of the other state’s investigation either residing in Illinois or being temporarily located in Illinois. To complete a courtesy interview request as an IO, the CFW shall document the same information as a child abuse or neglect report, including the names and contact information of the subjects and the subject’s current location in Illinois. The supervisor approved IO should be printed, “Information Only” struck thru, and “CPS Courtesy Interview” written across the top of the page. The completed IO must then be faxed to the appropriate RSF. Note: When assessing a potential case of child abuse or neglect where one or more subjects is living or temporarily staying in another state, consult the in-state/out-of-state grid chart located in Procedures 300.20 (g)(7) Out of State Reports.

Note: A CWS referral can be accepted to assess the family for service needs and linkage to available local community resources. A) Who May Refer CWS referrals may only be taken from the adult subjects of the referral, others residing in the subject’s home or a mandated reporter. A child who lives in the residence may request services in certain circumstances. Neighbors, friends, relatives, cannot make a CWS referral; however the CFW shall explain to an ineligible caller who is eligible to make the referral. A CWS referral can be made to the Hotline or directly to the local field office. SCR will not complete referrals at the request of DCFS field staff. Field staff can create CWS intakes on their own. B) Response to Requests for Child Welfare Services Department staff who provide child welfare services, including Child Protection Specialists, shall address CWS referrals which are forwarded by the SCR as well as those received directly from police, social service agencies, schools, medical personnel, other public or private agencies, or household/family members. C) Types of CWS Referrals Types of CWS referrals include, but are not limited to: i) Dependency Under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 [705 ILCS 405], only police can take limited custody of dependent children. The date and time of the limited custody should be documented in the narrative of a CWS dependency intake with an Action Needed response code, when appropriate.

The Extended Family Support Program (EFSP) provides short term services to a child residing in the care of a relative for the foreseeable future for which short-term interventions will stabilize the relative household and allow for continued care of the child in the household. Children served by this program may not have a legal relationship with the Department and must be referred for EFSP services by the caregiver they currently reside with by contacting either the State Central Register, local Child Protection staff, or the Post Adoption Unit. EFSP services may consist of guidance in obtaining legal guardianship of the child, counseling services, benefits advocacy, educational advocacy, medical advocacy, housing advocacy, mediation, and referrals for legal services. For eligibility requirements to EFSP, refer to Procedures 302.389, Extended Family Support Program The following information should be included in an EFSP intake: • Date of the caregiver/child(ren)’s last contact with the biological parent(s) or legal guardian; • Service needs of the child/caregiver; • How and why the child came to live with the caregiver; • Length of time the child has been living with the caregiver; • Child’s physical and/or mental disabilities, if any; • Other services currently being received by the child, if any; • Behavior problems the child regularly exhibits, if any; and • Names, birthdates and any other identifying information for both biological parents, if available. Include at least one biological parent as a participant; if one parent has custody of the child in question, that parent should be the one included.

procedures-300_55_text,"DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES model GUIDE 2020.08 RULES AND PROCEDURES 300, REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT DATE: April 13, 2020 TO: All DCFS and POS Staff FROM: Marc D. Smith, Acting Director EFFECTIVE: Immediately I. PURPOSE The purpose of this model guide is to inform staff and mandated reporters of changes pursuant to Public Act 101-0564 and Public Act 101-0237 which amend the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act and require amendments to Rules 300, Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect. These statutory changes are effective January 1, 2020. To the extent that any of the required activities in Section IV and V differ from Rules 300.20 and 300.30 or Procedures 300.15 and 300.30, this model Guide controls. Amendments to the Rules and Procedures 300 are being drafted and will be released in the near future. II. PRIMARY USERS DCFS Staff, POS Staff and Mandated Reporters III. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY Public Act 101-0564 redefines who is statutorily recognized as Mandated Reporters in the State of Illinois, and what is to be considered “a child known to them in their professional or official capacities”. It prescribes reporting requirements when there are two or more persons working together who share concerns about whether a child is abused or neglected and who else can make a report with reasonable cause. It also adds mandated reporter training frequency and requirements, including sources of training for mandated reporters and licensed practitioners and reporting of completed training. Public Act 101-0237 establishes that when a Mandated Reporter makes a report to the State Central Register and there is a prior indicated report of abuse or neglect or there is a prior open service case involving any member of the household that the Department must minimally accept a report as a child welfare services referral. If the family refuses to cooperate or refuses access to the home or children, then a child protection service investigation shall be initiated if the facts meet the criteria to accept a report.",427,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf

The designated reporter must provide written confirmation of the report to those mandated reporters within 48 hours.

procedures-300_58_text,"d) As used in this Section, ""a child known to them in their professional or official capacities"" means: 1) the mandated reporter comes into contact with the child in the course of the reporter's employment or practice of a profession, or through a regularly scheduled program, activity, or service; 2) the mandated reporter is affiliated with an agency, institution, organization, school, school district, regularly established church or religious organization, or other entity that is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance, or training of the child; or 3) a person makes a specific disclosure to the mandated reporter that an identifiable child is the victim of child abuse or child neglect, and the disclosure happens while the mandated reporter is engaged in his or her employment or practice of a profession, or in a regularly scheduled program, activity, or service. Nothing in this Section requires a child to come before the mandated reporter in order for the reporter to make a report of suspected child abuse or child neglect. [325 ILCS 5/4] e) Mandated Reporter Training 1) Persons required to report child abuse or child neglect as provided under this Section must complete an initial mandated reporter training within 3 months of their date of engagement in a professional or official capacity as a mandated reporter, or within the time frame of any other applicable State law that governs training requirements for a specific profession, and at least every 3 years thereafter.

The mandated reporter shall maintain records of completion. 5) Beginning January 1, 2021, if a mandated reporter receives licensure from the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or the State Board of Education, and his or her profession has continuing education requirements, the training mandated under this Section shall count toward meeting the licensee's required continuing education hours. 6) Medical personnel, as listed in paragraph (1) of Section 4(a) of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act who work with children in their professional or official capacity, must complete mandated reporter training at least every 6 years. Such medical personnel, if licensed, must attest at each time of licensure renewal on their renewal form that they understand they are a mandated reporter of child abuse and neglect, that they are aware of the process for making a report, that they know how to respond to a child in a trauma-informed manner, and that they are aware of the role of child protective services and the role of a reporter after a call has been made. 7) In lieu of repeated training, medical personnel, as listed in paragraph (1) of Section 4(a), of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, who do not work with children in their professional or official capacity, may instead attest each time at licensure renewal on their renewal form that they understand they are a mandated reporter of child abuse and neglect, that they are aware of the process for making a report, that they know how to respond to a child in a trauma-informed manner, and that they are aware of the role of child protective services and the role of a reporter after a call has been made. Nothing in this paragraph precludes medical personnel from completing mandated reporter training and receiving continuing education credits for that training.

The statement shall be on a form prescribed by the Department but provided by the employer. (See Appendix A.) The statement shall be signed before beginning employment and shall be retained by the employer as a permanent part of the personnel record.

Under no circumstances shall any person in charge of such institution, school, facility or agency, or church, synagogue, temple, mosque or other religious institution, or designated agent to whom such notification has been made exercise any control, restraint, modification or other change in the report or the forwarding of such report to the Department. [325 ILCS 5/4] 2) Any person who knowingly transmits a false report to the Department commits the offense of disorderly conduct under subsection (a)(7) of Section 26-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. A violation of this provision is a Class 4 felony. Any person who knowingly and willfully violates any provision of [Section 4 of the Act] other than a second or subsequent violation of transmitting a false report as described in the preceding paragraph, is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor for a first violation and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent violation. [325 ILCS 5/4] 3) No employer shall discharge, demote or suspend, or threaten to discharge, demote or suspend, or in any manner discriminate against any employee who makes any good faith oral or written report of suspected child abuse or neglect, or who is or will be a witness or testify in any investigation or proceeding concerning a report of suspected child abuse or neglect.

procedures-300_61_text,"h) Consequences of Failure to Report 1) The privileged quality of communication between any professional person required to report and his or her patient or client shall not apply to situations involving abused or neglected children and shall not constitute grounds for failure to report as required by the Act or constitute grounds for failure to share information or documents with the Department during the course of a child abuse or neglect investigation. If requested by the professional, the Department shall confirm in writing that the information or documents disclosed by the professional were gathered in the course of a child abuse or neglect investigation. [325 ILCS 5/4] Mandated reporters who willfully fail to report suspected child abuse or neglect are subject to license suspension or revocation in accordance with, but not limited to, the following statutes: A) Nurse Practice Act of 1987 [225 ILCS 65]; B) Medical Practice Act of 1987 [225 ILCS 60]; C) Podiatric Medical Practice Act of 1987 [225 ILCS 100]; D) Clinical Psychologist Licensing Act [225 ILCS 15]; E) Clinical Social Worker and Social Work Practice Act [225 ILCS 20]; F) The School Code [105 ILCS 5]; G) The Illinois Dental Practice Act [225 ILCS 25]; H) Physician Assistant Practice Act of 1987 [225 ILCS 95]; I) Illinois Optometric Practice Act of 1987 [225 ILCS 80]; J) Illinois Physical Therapy Act [225 ILCS 90]; and K) Illinois Athletic Trainers Act [225 ILCS 5]. 2) Any physician who willfully fails to report child abuse or neglect shall be referred to the Illinois State Medical Disciplinary Board for action and similar referrals are required for dentists and dental hygienists.

These confirmation reports shall be admissible as evidence in any administrative or judicial proceeding related to child abuse or neglect. Local investigative staff shall transmit confirmation reports to the State Central Register within 24 hours after receipt. j) Other Persons May Report In addition to the persons required to report suspected cases of child abuse or child neglect under this Section, any other person may make a report if such person has reasonable cause to believe a child may be an abused child or a neglected child. [325 ILCS 5/4] k) Consequences of False Reporting Any person who knowingly transmits a false report to the Department commits the offense of disorderly conduct under subsection (a)(7) of Section 26-1of the Criminal Code of 2012. A violation of this provision is a Class 4 felony. Any person who knowingly and willfully violates any provision of [Section 4 of the Act] other than a second or subsequent violation of submitting a false report as described in the preceding paragraph is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor for a first violation and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent violation. [325 ILCS 5/4] The Department shall refer cases of false reporting to the local State's Attorney when the reporter is known. l) Cooperation in Court or Administrative Hearings Any person who makes a report or who investigates a report under the Act shall testify fully in any judicial proceeding or administrative hearing resulting from such report, as to any evidence of abuse or neglect, or the cause thereof.

[325 ILCS 5/4] Where the circumstances indicate harm or substantial risk of harm to the child's health or welfare and medical care necessary to treat or prevent that harm or risk of harm is not being provided because a parent or other person responsible for the child's welfare depends upon such spiritual means, the child shall be subject to the requirements of the Act for the reporting of, investigation of, and provision of protective services with respect to the child and his or her health needs. Pursuant to Public Act 101-0237 the following revisions will be included in Procedures 300 Section 300.30 (i)(2): Child Welfare Services (CWS) Referrals When a Call Floor Worker receives information from a mandated reporter and the information reported to the Hotline does not meet the requirements under ANCRA for an investigation, and there is a prior indicated report of abuse or neglect, or there is a prior open service case involving any member of the household, a CWS referral will be completed.

The MRAI program is intended to divert these children/youth from the judicial system. The Department of Human Services contracted agencies provide services to children/youth who are unwilling to return home or whose parent is unable to control their behavior. • Making the Referral: When a child/youth is unwilling to return home and there has been no police involvement, the caller should be directed to contact local law enforcement for assistance or take the child to a police station. Should an officer take limited custody of the child/youth, the officer should involve the MRAI agency serving the geographical area. In situations where the parent refuses to allow the child to return home and refuses to arrange for an appropriate alternative placement, the CFW shall take a report of alleged neglect, Allegation #84, Lockout. The decision to accept a Lockout report is based solely on the actions of the parent and not on whether the child/youth is willing to return home. When an MRAI referral is based on a child/youth’s out of control behavior and the parent has been unable to contact the local MRAI agency on his/her own, or when a referral is coming from law enforcement, the CFW should make the referral by completing a CWS intake and checking “MRAI” on the decision tab. If law enforcement does not know how to contact the MRAI agency serving their area, instruct the officer to contact the Comprehensive Community Based Youth Services (CCBYS) Information Line at 800-786-2929 for assistance. Under no circumstance should the CFW give the after- hours phone numbers for MRAI agencies to the general public. • Younger Children Out of Control: When the out of control child is under 11 years of age, a CWS referral may be taken to assess the service needs of the family and to link them to available local community resources.

procedures-300_66_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 D) Changing a Referral Type i) Upon completion of person searches, if a pending report is discovered regarding any subject, the CFW shall change the CWS to a RI of the pending report and forward the RI to the assigned Child Protection Specialist. ii) If a CWS referral is made regarding a family who has an open service case or a pending CWS referral, the CFW shall document the information in an IO and send to the assigned caseworker at the appropriate RSF. When there is an identified service need for open cases involving an adoption subsidy or subsidized guardianship, a new CWS referral may be completed. Note: It is not appropriate to link an unrelated CWS referral to a pending investigation as a RI even though they may involve the same child. (e.g., during a pending facility investigation, the family of a victim calls requesting assistance totally unrelated to the pending investigation.) Note: CFWs shall not request a LEADS check for a CWS referral, except when notified by the police that a child is in custody and a LEADS check is necessary for placement purposes. 3) Licensing Referrals A) If a caller’s information does not meet the criteria for a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, but does identify problems in a licensed child care facility, the call shall be taken as a “Licensing Referral” intake. These intakes must be printed and transmitted to the Central Office of Licensing (COoL) in order to be sent to the local licensing unit. Licensing issues for facilities include, but are not limited to, corporal punishment, use of inappropriate language, inadequate staffing patterns, inadequate space, or a facility over capacity. Any person who has knowledge of a possible licensing violation occurring in a child care facility licensed by the State of Illinois can make this type of report. B) A Licensing Referral should be completed for an unlicensed day care facility where it appears the day care owner provides care for too many children to be exempt from licensure. To be exempt from licensing as a day care home, Rule 377, Facilities and Programs Exempt from Licensure, stipulates: “Family homes that care for no more than 3 children under the age of 12 or that receive only children from a single household, for less than 24 hours per day, are exempt from licensure as day care homes. The three children to whom this exemption applies includes the family's natural or adopted children and any other persons under the age of 12 whether related or unrelated to the operator of the day care home.” In almost all other circumstances, the home must be licensed.

See Procedures 300, Appendix K, for definitions of unsafe sleep conditions and definitions that relate to the unusual death of an infant. Documenting an Unusual Death • SCR documents all child deaths in an intake. The CFW shall document the information as a SUID/Unusual Death, print the intake and write “Death” across the top, and immediately walk the printed intake up to the Call Floor Supervisor on duty. The CFW or a Call Floor Supervisor on duty shall complete the Death Log and all person searches, but shall not request a LEADS check for SUID or Unusual Deaths. If the deceased child is a DCFS ward, the CFW shall document the name and contact information of the caseworker in the intake narrative, check the ward box on the intake decision tab and write “Death of a Ward” at the top of the printed intake. • All calls concerning a SUID/Unusual Death report require documentation in an intake, even if the caller is only requesting a person search. 5) Mandated Caller/No Report Taken (MCNRT) When a mandated reporter calls SCR and reports an incident or situation that does not qualify as a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, referral for services, licensing referral, or any other type of intake, the CFW shall document the call as a Mandated Caller No Report Taken (MCNRT). Examples of reasons a CFW might document a MCNRT include, but are not limited to: • An perpetrator who is not eligible; • A victim age 18-22 who does not reside in a licensed facility (after ensuring the reporter has been directed to call the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Human Services); • No child abuse or neglect issues are reported; or • The need for additional information to determine whether the reporter’s concern qualifies as a child abuse or neglect report.

procedures-300_68_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 To complete a MCNRT, the CFW must perform a person search, briefly describe the situation reported and document the reason(s) the report was not accepted. If there is an open DCFS case or pending child protection investigation a MCNRT should not be taken. The CFW should send an IO to the appropriate caseworker or an RI to the assigned Child Protection Specialist, if the caller’s information is relevant to the pending investigation. The CFW shall inform the caller that their information will not be taken as a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, the reason why the call was not accepted as a report and that the caller’s information will be documented and retained on file at SCR for six months. The mandated reporter should be given the intake number of the MCNRT for future reference. If the mandated reporter wishes to dispute the CFWs decision, the CFW shall forward the MCNRT to the supervisor on duty for review with a note in the narrative section stating that the mandated reporter disputes the decision. The supervisor on duty shall then call the mandated reporter for further consultation. A supervisor must review and approve all MCNRTs. The completed MCNRT serves as documentation and protection for both the mandated reporter and the CFW. MCNRTs are never transmitted to an RSF. 6) Calls Concerning Unprofessional Behavior of a Child Protection Specialist Any call received from a mandated reporter regarding alleged unprofessional behavior by a Child Protection Specialist (e.g., apparent intoxication, a threatening demeanor or other similar unprofessional behavior) shall be documented in an I & R, upon consultation with the Call Floor Supervisor on duty, and shall then be immediately communicated to the appropriate Area Administrator so that the Area Administrator may respond to the mandated reporter’s concern. 7) Information and Referral (I & R) This intake type is used when providing general information and/or making a verbal referral to the caller to use the services of another agency. 8) Hang Up/Wrong Number This intake type is used when receiving an incoming call and the caller identifies they have called the wrong number or just hang up with no response. 9) Crank Calls/Harassment This intake type is used when it is quickly evident the caller has no serious intention for using the Hotline for its intended purposes.

procedures-300_69_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 10) Transfer This intake type is used to transfer the caller to another SCR staff, supervisor, or other Department unit. 11) SCR Maintenance This intake type is primarily used to assist field staff with a particular SCR number or SACWIS issue. It would be appropriate to use this category when completing a background check and releasing information about a pending case to a police officer, physician, or another state’s child protection unit. 12) Miscellaneous Calls This intake type should be used rarely. It should only be used for calls which do not fit any other category. j) Documentation of Unusual Incident Reports Concerning DCFS Wards with Sexually Problematic Behaviors When a caller alleges that a DCFS ward (regardless of age) has been sexually aggressive or has exhibited sexually problematic behaviors, including consensual sex involving another ward, the CFW shall complete a CFS 119, Unusual Incident Report. A CFS 119 is completed only when a caller reports sexual abuse or exploitation by a ward, including situations in which a ward is exhibiting sexually aggressive or problematic behavior. A CFS 119 must be accompanied by an IO to the caseworker documenting the incident and the notation “CFS 119 completed” in the narrative. Note: CFWs should remind POS workers who complete the unusual incident report to use the CFS 119 rather than the private agency’s UIR form. k) Educational Neglect DCFS does not accept or investigate reports of educational neglect. Each school district employs truant officers who handle issues involving school attendance. CFWs should refer all callers to the child's school or the school's district office to report chronic non- attendance. The CFW shall complete an Educational Neglect form to document calls from individuals who are not school staff but know of children who are of age and are not enrolled in school. Designated SCR staff shall mail the Educational Neglect forms to the appropriate Regional Superintendent of Schools for follow-up. CFWs should not complete an educational neglect form without enough identifying information to locate the child.

procedures-300_70_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 l) Reporting Unusual Incidents CFWs periodically need to document unusual calls to the hotline, such as callers who threaten staff or make persistent crank/obscene calls. The CFW shall alert the Call Floor Supervisor on duty or an SCR Administrator when such a call is received. The Call Floor Supervisor on duty or SCR Administrator shall contact appropriate Department personnel, when necessary. If a CFW believes that someone’s life is in immediate danger, based on a caller’s threat or information about a threat, the CFW shall call the appropriate law enforcement agency to report the danger and notify the Call Floor Supervisor on duty of the incident. To document an unusual incident, the CFW shall send an email to the Call Floor Supervisor on duty. The email should include the following information, if available: • Name and other identifying information of the caller; • Date and time of the call and the telephone number from which the call was received; • The content of the telephone call; • The number of previous calls made, as well as dates, times and content of the previous calls, if known; • If a threat was made, and the reason the caller might wish to threaten DCFS/POS staff or a service provider; and • Any other pertinent information. m) Crank Calls If a crank call is received, inform the caller that this is the Child Abuse Hotline, if the caller does not hang up right away, do not hesitate to hang up. If a crank caller persistently calls the hotline, the CFW shall notify the Call Floor Supervisor on duty of the crank calls via email and consult with the Call Floor Supervisor on duty, as needed. n) Referrals Involving Developmentally Delayed Adults (Age 18 – 59) Who Do Not Live in a DCFS Licensed Facility When SCR receives a report of suspected abuse, neglect or financial exploitation of a disabled adult between the ages of 18 and 59 years who does not reside in a DCFS licensed facility, the CFW shall instruct the caller to contact the Department of Human Services (DHS) Office of Inspector General and shall provide the caller with the state- wide 24-hour toll free number (866-800-1409). If the caller provides the CFW with enough information, the CFW may contact the DHS OIG to make the report of possible disabled adult abuse/neglect.

If the caller provides the CFW with enough information, the CFW may contact the Senior Helpline to make a report of possible elder abuse/neglect. p) Informal Referrals If the caller desires services or information not appropriate for a CWS referral, use the resource information available in the reference fan located at each call floor work station and refer the caller to the most appropriate agency or service provider. q) Requests for Information 1) Confidentiality of Child Abuse or Neglect Information All information regarding reports of child abuse or neglect received by the hotline is confidential. Only five categories of individuals (listed below) are permitted to receive report information by telephone without the consent of the report subjects. Information can be provided only when DCFS receives an appropriate written or oral request for information. See Rule 431.80 and 431.90, as well as Procedures 431.40, Release of Client Record Information to Persons or Entities with Appropriate Written or Oral Request. A) Individuals Who Are Able to Receive Information From Hotline Staff: • Child Protection staff, when the information sought is relevant to a pending report of child abuse or neglect; • Law enforcement officials investigating a report of child abuse/neglect or determining whether a child should be taken into protective custody; • A Physician examining or treating a child who needs information to determine whether a child is abuse or neglected, or to determine whether a child should be taken into protective custody; • Coroners and Medical Examiners who are performing autopsies or scene investigations on subjects of a death report; and • Out-of-state child protection agencies involved in a child abuse or neglect investigation. See Rule 431.80, Disclosure of Records of Child Abuse and Neglect Investigations. Verification of Caller’s Identity: The requestor’s identity and authority to receive the information must be verified prior to providing any requested information. CFWs MUST NEVER PROVIDE INFORMATION TO UNKNOWN REQUESTORS. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",484,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_72_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 B) Verifying Caller’s Identity i) At times, law enforcement officers call the hotline to obtain information regarding DCFS involvement with a family. In an emergency situation, it may be necessary for the CFW to assist law enforcement by providing essential information regarding the family in order for the officer to make immediate and vital decisions regarding a child’s safety. Only pertinent information concerning the current emergency situation should be released. Information can only be released after identity verification of the caller. Regarding closed service cases and indicated investigations, the CFW may release limited information to a law enforcement officer when such information is directly related to a police investigation and only once the CFW has verified the officer’s identity with his/her police department or precinct. In non-emergency situations, it is not required for the CFW to release information concerning a pending report over the phone. An officer investigating a case related to a pending report should be given the assigned Child Protection Specialist’s contact information and urged to contact him/her or his/her supervisor. ii) Verification of a caller’s identity can usually be obtained by checking an official telephone listing or checking with a third party at the main phone number of the requestor’s reported place of employment. The CFW shall obtain the requestor’s name, official capacity, an official business phone number through which his identity and authority to receive the information can be verified, and the phone number of his/her current location. If a police officer in the field has provided his contact number in the field, this number must also be verified with police station personnel. When in doubt of the requestor’s identity or authority to receive such information, the CFW shall deny the telephone request and instruct the requestor to send a notarized written request (See Procedures 431.130(b)) or refer the requestor to the Child Protection Specialist investigating a pending report. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",401,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_73_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 CFWs shall verify the identity of the caller requesting information by the following methods: • DCFS and private agency staff – Ask for the worker’s name and identification number and compare to the information in the DCFS database. The ID number and name must match in order to release information to the requestor. Upper-level DCFS administrative staff with a valid ID number can receive any information, including information regarding Undetermined and Unfounded investigations. • Law Enforcement Officer – Obtain the badge number, present location of the officer, officer’s beat number for the day, and/or the current location telephone number as well as the police station or precinct main non-emergency number. Call the main non-emergency number to verify the officer’s identity. • Physician/Coroner/Cook County Medical Examiner (CCME) – Request the hospital main phone number or the hospital department phone number from the requestor. Verify the main number with directory assistance or other resource and ask to be transferred to the appropriate department. Once caller’s identity is verified, the physician, coroner or medical examiner should be called back and provided the information requested. • If the caller is a hospital or clinic staff member calling on behalf of the physician, verify that both the staff member and the physician are employees and are on duty. Release information only if the caller is able to provide information verifying that the physician has reasonable cause to believe that the child before him/her may be abused or neglected or the person search is related to a SUID/Unusual Death report. C) For an Incoming Call The only time information can be released on an incoming call to the hotline is when the caller is a DCFS or POS employee with a valid ID number. The CFW must call back all others, including doctors and police officers, to verify their identities. With the exception of police officers in the field, no information can be released to anyone who is not at their place of employment, as the CFW has no way to verify the caller’s identity. When a judge requests information, the CFW shall refer the judge to the Office of Legal Services. Requests for information from any source (including probation officers) other than one of the five previously identified must be in writing and mailed to the SCR Administrator at 406 E. Monroe, Station #30, Springfield, IL, 62701 or faxed to SCR at 217- 782-2701.

Intact and Permanency Supervisors and Administrators shall NEVER release the reporter’s name. 2) Caseworker Information While much of the information related to DCFS services is confidential by law, the CFW may share limited information with certain callers to assist with the provision of services, particularly emergency services. Mandated callers requesting information should be referred to the local field office, downstate requestors should be referred to the local office; Cook County requestors should be referred to case tracking at 773-371-6161. The CFW must verify the caller’s identity and determine the purpose of the request before referring the caller to the local field office or releasing information over the telephone. Requests from mandated reporters for information from the database must concern one of two issues: 1) whether the child is a ward; or 2) whether there is an open service case on a specific family. NON-MANDATED REPORTERS SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN INFORMATION. DCFS/POS staff should have access to this information in their own offices and/or from their laptop computers. However, in after-hours emergency situations, Child Protection Specialists and Intact/Permanency Workers may call SCR for information such as legal status, placement and name of the current caseworker. Emergency medical and law enforcement personnel may be given information on the legal status of a child in care. For additional assistance, refer these callers to the local field office or, if necessary, contact the appropriate on-call Child Protection Specialist. School personnel should be aware if a child in their school is a DCFS ward and should know the name of the caseworker and contact information of the foster parent. The CFW should not discuss with school personnel whether there is an open family service case. If school personnel want to forward information to the caseworker, the CFW should take an IO and forward the information on to the child’s caseworker.

The CFW may release this information in this circumstance, upon verification of the Youth Crisis Agency worker’s identity. 3) Out-of-State Requests for History Out-of-state child protection/welfare agencies and private adoption agencies often contact the Hotline to request background information/history on families with whom Illinois DCFS has been involved in the past. CFWs can facilitate the out- of-state agencies’ efforts to obtain information by providing the caller with the following information: • Out-of-state child protection/welfare agencies: Instruct the caller to write the request on their agency letterhead and fax it to the Placement Clearance Unit Supervisor 217-782-3991. Have the requestor include the names of the family members, dates of birth, and the family’s previous Illinois address. • Out-of-state adoption agencies: Instruct the caller to complete a CFS 689, Authorization for Background Check for Programs NOT Licensed by DCFS. The CFS 689 is available on the DCFS Website. If the out-of-state child protection/welfare agency or adoption agency cannot wait for a reply from the Placement Clearance Unit Supervisor (e.g., the information is necessary for a court hearing that day), the CFW may provide background information to the agency if the requestor faxes a written request to SCR 217-782- 2701 on the requesting agency’s letterhead. r) Requests from Medical Providers for DCFS Guardian’s Consent 1) Where and When to Call for Consent Downstate medical providers must call the SCR after hours consent line 217- 782-6533, when requesting after hours consent for routine and ordinary medical care for wards and children who are under the age of 18 and in protective custody. The SCR after hours consent line is used after 5:00 PM weekdays as well as holidays and weekends. SCR staff shall document the request on a consent form and ensure a copy is sent to the DCFS or POS field office that has case management responsibilities for the child. Cook County medical providers seeking medical consent for wards and children under the age of 18 who are in protective custody during afterhours, weekends and holidays, must call the DCFS After Hours Service Phone 773-538-8800.

The CFW shall perform the following when a report is generated based on the information in the correspondence: 1) If the information in the correspondence qualifies as a report or RI, a copy of the correspondence shall be faxed by the Production Control Unit (PCU) to the appropriate field office with the SCR number written across the top of the copy. When a CANTS 1 is faxed to SCR from a DCFS field office and is accepted as a report, the CANTS 1 information shall be entered into the database and the CFW shall write the SCR # or Intake ID # on and “entered by___” (name of CFW) across the top of both pages of the CANTS 1. A copy of the report and the original CANTS 1 shall be faxed back to the field office of origin. 2) If the information contained in the correspondence does not meet the criteria for a report or RI to a pending report, then the CFW must document so in one of the following ways: • IO: The CFW shall complete an IO to be sent to the assigned caseworker if any of the subjects of the correspondence has an open service case; • Referral for Services: The CFW shall take a CWS referral if the correspondence meets the criteria for a referral, there is a need for services and the written correspondence is from a mandated reporter, the child’s primary caregiver, or an immediate family member who resides in the household; • MCNRT: If the information is from a mandated reporter and is not appropriate for a report of child abuse or neglect, License Referral, CWS or IO, the CFW shall complete a MCNRT and submit the MCNRT for supervisory approval. • IO not transmitted: If the correspondence is from a non-mandated reporter, the CFW shall complete an IO.

For additional information concerning runaway wards, CFWs shall refer to Procedures 329, Locating and Returning Missing, Runaway, and Abducted Children. 2) Out-of-State Runaway Wards When a runaway child for whom another state has legal responsibility, has been located in Illinois, the return of that child to his/her home state must be coordinated through Comprehensive Community Based Youth Services (CCBYS) Interstate Commission. CFWs who receive a call concerning a runaway should direct the caller to contact the National Runaway Safeline at 1-800-786-2929 in order to connect with CCBYS. 3) All Other Runaway Children (Non-Wards) When SCR receives a call regarding a child who has run away from home or a facility and the caller does not allege an incident of abuse or neglect, the CFW shall refer the caller to local law enforcement. The law enforcement officer should in turn make arrangement for the child to be handed over to CCBYS for an eventual return. If the caller is a law enforcement officer, the CFW shall direct the officer to contact CCBYS at 1-800-786-2929. u) Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) If an out-of-state agency requests a home study in order to place a child with a relative in Illinois or to monitor an out-of-state family while the family is in Illinois, the CFW should not take a CWS referral.

During after-hours operations, the CFW shall verbally notify the on-call Child Protection Supervisor of reports received, per the after- hours protocol established by the Deputy Chief of Child Protection. As Cook County Child Protection Specialists are available on a 24 hour basis, CFWs are not required to notify them verbally of after-hours reports, but shall transmit after-hours reports according the after-hours protocol established by the Deputy Chief of Child Protection. b) Reports Taken at a Local DCFS Office When a person calls a local DCFS office to make a report of suspected child abuse or neglect and the local office has call-transferring capability, the call shall be transferred to the toll-free hotline number as soon as local office staff determines the caller’s intent and the caller agrees to be transferred. The Department shall make every effort to accommodate the communication needs of those who are limited/non-English speaking or hearing impaired (e.g., use of interpreters, the Illinois Relay System, TDD/TTYs).

CFWs should consult with the supervisor on duty for situations that do not fall into the categories below. 1) When SCR makes an original case assignment, the report shall be assigned to the RSF where the child victim resides. If there are child victims in multiple RSFs, assignment should be made based on the residence of the primary victim, if there is one. Example: One child is sexually abused and other children are considered to be at risk of sexual injury. In such an investigation, primary assignment would go to the RSF of the sexually abused child and the RSF of the children at risk would be the parallel assignment. Other factors that must be given consideration when making case assignment are: • which RSF has the most victims; • where the incident occurred; and • where the perpetrator lives. 2) Reports are frequently made involving children (usually children in Department care) who are in placement in a different RSF than where they originated. The CFW shall determine if the caller is referring to a current incident of harm or a past incident of abuse or neglect and where the incident occurred. If the incident of harm occurred in the substitute care placement, the case shall be assigned to the RSF where the placement is located and the incident occurred. If the incident occurred prior to placement or during a home or family visit, the primary assignment shall be made as if the child were living in their home RSF, with their placement/current location as the parallel assignment. 3) Call Floor Workers shall call local law enforcement to confirm the county in which a reported address is located when making case assignment and there is uncertainty of the location of the reported address. When county identification is in doubt, confirmation of the county of the reported address must be made prior to making primary or parallel assignment.

In such cases the Child Protection Supervisor of the erroneously assigned RSF must send prompt notification to SCR of the need for case reassignment in order to avoid or minimize any delay in meeting the initiation mandate. The Child Protection Supervisor of the erroneously assigned RSF may transmit the report directly to the correct RSF, however he/she must have a discussion with the Child Protection Supervisor of the correct RSF at least 4 business hours before the expiration of the initiation mandate. Reports that have less than 4 hours to meet the initiation mandate must be initiated by the Child Protection Specialist of the originally (erroneously) assigned RSF. 5) Examples of cases that require the concurrence of the accepting Child Protection Supervisor (or designee) include, but are not limited to: • When the address of a report subject is incomplete, questionable, or there is conflicting information regarding the address of residence; and • Reports where the report subjects were not initially located, but once located, it is determined that they live in an area covered by another RSF. 6) SCR may receive notification from a Child Protection Supervisor that a change of assignment is required. When there is disagreement between Child Protection Supervisors regarding the need for a change of case assignment, the following procedures shall be followed. • If the disagreement is between two Child Protection Supervisors in the same Region, the decision will be made by the Area Administrator (AA). • If the disagreement is between two Child Protection Supervisors in different Regions, attempts should first be made to resolve the issue between the respective AAs. If the AAs are unable to resolve the conflict, the decision shall be referred to the appropriate Associate Deputy Director of Child Protection.

procedures-300_90_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 d) Good Faith Determination and Unqualified Reports 1) Good Faith Report The purpose of the initial investigative activities is for the Child Protection Specialist to confirm that there is a good faith basis for belief that abuse or neglect occurred and a normal investigation is warranted. 2) Activities Child Protection Specialists must complete the following investigative activities to determine whether a good faith report exists: • Initiate the report within the 24-hour mandate by in-person contacts or good faith attempts; • In-person contact with the alleged victim or victims and in-person examination of the environment for inadequate shelter and environmental neglect reports only, and a completed a safety assessment; • In-person or telephone contact with the reporter, if the reporter's identity and whereabouts are known or the source of the report, if the source’s identity is known; and If the child has an injury or illness consistent with the allegation and has been seen by a medical professional, the Child Protection Specialist must have a conversation with the examining medical professional. Note: Child Protection Specialist shall not request that a child remain in a hospital pending further investigative activities when the child has been medically cleared for discharge. Complete a person search and LEADS check (LEADS is for persons over 13 years of age) on the subjects of the report and all members of the household. 3) Good Faith Determination A) Within 14 days of receipt of the report, if any one of the factors listed below is not present, a determination will be made that the report is not a good faith report of alleged child abuse or neglect and the investigation will be terminated. The Child Protection Specialist shall “initial unfound” the report after consultation with the Child Protection Supervisor and Area Administrator. Factors that must be present to determine that a report of abuse or neglect is a good faith report of alleged abuse or neglect include the following: • The alleged victim or victims must be less than 18 years of age, or youth 18-22 years of age residing in a DCFS licensed facility; Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",432,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_91_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 • The alleged victim or victims must have been harmed or must be at substantial risk of physical injury; • There must be an abusive or neglectful incident or set of circumstances as defined in Procedures 300.Appendix B, The Allegations System, that caused the alleged harm or substantial risk of physical injury to the child; and • There must be an eligible perpetrator of the alleged abuse or neglect. For abuse, the alleged perpetrator must be the child's parent, foster parent, guardian, immediate family member, any individual who resides in the same house as the child, the paramour of the child's parent, or any person responsible for the child's welfare at the time of the alleged abuse. For neglect, the alleged perpetrator must be the child's parent, guardian, foster parent, or any person responsible for the child's welfare at the time of the alleged neglect, which can include the paramour if the parent is not present. B) The Department shall notify the following persons upon determining a report will be initially unfounded due to not meeting the good faith criteria and will inform them that further investigation will not proceed: 1) Mandated reporters; 2) Custodial parents, personal guardians, and legal custodians of the alleged child victim(s); and 3) Alleged perpetrators. Note: Any report without face-to-face contact with the child victim may be terminated and unfounded only with the approval of the Area Administrator. C) The Child Protection Specialist shall confer with the Child Protection Supervisor regarding contact with law enforcement and/or the State’s Attorney prior to revealing a finding of “initial unfound” to any of the subjects of the report. If there is no criminal investigation, but there is evidence of a crime, the Child Protection Specialist shall consult with the supervisor and then refer the matter to law enforcement. 4) Unqualified Reports An unqualified report is a report where it has been determined that there is not an alleged victim and/or eligible perpetrator of alleged abuse or neglect as defined in Procedures 300.15, Definitions. A report determined to be an unqualified report must be reviewed by the Area Administrator within 24 hours after the determination is made by the Child Protection Specialist and the Child Protection Supervisor.

Child Protection Specialists do not begin the time frame cycle over again once the good faith determination has been made. The contacts made during the initial investigative activities will not need to be repeated unless there are changes in circumstances and assessed information and/or the Child Protection Supervisor identifies the need to redo an activity. If the family has resided outside Illinois, the Child Protection Specialist is required to request out of state LEADS as described in Administrative Procedure 6.3. e) Initiation of the Investigation 1) Initiation (24-Hour Mandate) The investigation is initiated by in-person contact with the alleged child victim or victims within 24 hours of the receipt of the report, or by a good faith attempt to contact the alleged child victim or victims. Where the soonest possible opportunity for the Child Protection Specialist to engage the alleged child victim through in-person contact occurs in a school setting, school personnel are required to cooperate with the Child Protection Specialists in their responsibility to gather and assess child safety in a pending investigation. Child Protection Specialists may present school staff with the documentation of agreement between the Department and the Illinois School Board of Education (CANTS 101). For Allegation #77 (Inadequate Shelter) or #82 (Environmental Neglect), the investigation is initiated by in-person contact with the alleged child victim AND examination of the environment. The Child Protection Specialist is responsible for prioritizing risk to the alleged child victim and determining the actions to be taken to establish in-person contact with the child. In determining whether the child should be seen sooner than the next day, all available information (e.g., child’s age, allegation information, person search and LEADS history) must be assessed to make an interim determination of the child’s safety. A) The 24-hour initiation mandate may be met by law enforcement. Police-only contact with the alleged victim is not sufficient if the investigation is determined to not be a “good faith” report unless the investigation has been delegated to law enforcement. The Child Protection Specialist shall document the date and time of the initial in-person contact with each alleged child victim or the examination of the environment in a contact note. For additional information and instruction regarding delegated initiations, see Section 300.50(f)(1), Delegated Initiation of the Investigation. B) When investigating the death of a child, the Child Protection Specialist is able to meet the initiation mandate by collecting information regarding the child’s death from the Coroner or Medical Examiner.

In all other cases, the investigation shall be initiated within 24 hours of receipt of the report. D) If the adult caregiver refuses to allow the Child Protection Specialist to see or speak with the alleged child victim or victims, the Child Protection Specialist shall explain that ANCRA [325 ILCS 5/7.5] gives the Child Protection Specialist authority to see the children. If the Child Protection Specialist is still denied access to the children, the Child Protection Specialist shall immediately contact local law enforcement to assist in contacting the child. If necessary to obtain access, the Child Protection Specialist shall consult with the Office of Legal Services to pursue a court order. E) An investigation is not in compliance with statutory requirements for initiation until the safety of the alleged child victims has been assessed and their safety assured, or there have been good faith attempts to assess the safety of all the alleged child victims. The safety of all alleged child victims must be assessed before an investigation is considered initiated. Note: When investigating abuse or neglect that is alleged to have occurred to a child while being cared for by a babysitter, the Child Protection Specialist shall determine and identify the names of all other children for whom the babysitter provides care, including the babysitter’s own children. When appropriate, the other children should be interviewed and added to the investigation as additional child victims. 2) Good Faith Attempt to Initiate an Investigation The Child Protection Specialist shall document in a contact note each good faith attempt to establish in-person contact with the alleged child victims and the reason each attempt was unsuccessful. The following circumstances constitute a good faith attempt to initiate an investigation: • The Child Protection Specialist learns, upon proceeding to the location given for the alleged child victim in the report, that the child has disappeared, the family has fled, the address does not exist, no one is at the location, or not all of the alleged child victims are at the given location. • The Child Protection Specialist shall take whatever steps are necessary to obtain the current location of the alleged child victims and proceed immediately to their location. • Good faith attempts must be made every 24 hours or sooner, including weekends and holidays, until the child victim is seen, unless a waiver is granted by the Child Protection Supervisor. The fact that a good faith attempt was made Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",543,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf

Note: A Child Protection Specialist cannot be considered to have made a good faith attempt by continued attempts to see the child at the same location at the same time daily, without also taking additional steps to determine where and when the child may be seen (e.g., school or daycare). Note: Child Protection Supervisors shall manage and triage alerts for their Child Protection teams. The Child Protection Supervisor shall immediately address an alert indicating that a child victim has not been seen within 5 days of a report being taken and shall ensure that the child is seen and that the child is safe or that ongoing attempts to see the child continue per these procedures. Note: The Regional Administrator, Area Administrator and Child Protection Supervisor shall be responsible for tracking non-compliance of the 24 hour initiation. 3) Attempts to Locate the Child Victim If the report does not contain information that the Child Protection Specialist can use to quickly locate the alleged child victim or victims (e.g., names, current locations), the Child Protection Specialist shall take whatever steps are necessary, including but not limited to the following actions, to locate and establish in-person contact with the alleged child victims: • Ask the local, county, and state law enforcement agencies to check their records for information that would provide the location of the child/family; • Conduct a records check of the Department of Human Services and Secretary of State records (if a license plate number is known); • Conduct a diligent search in accordance with Administrative Procedure #22; • Contact the reporter or source of the report, if listed on the Intake; • Ask relatives and friends of the subjects to provide information to help locate the subjects; • Contact the child’s school or the school district to determine where the child is enrolled; or • Contact the local post office and utility companies to request a check of their records.

If possible, a multidisciplinary team approach to an investigation is preferred. If a child victim has a developmental disability, a forensic interview should be arranged through the local CAC, if available. When a Child Protection Specialist is also acting as a Forensic Interviewer for the team, the Child Protection Specialist must first complete 32 hours of approved initial training and maintain a minimum of 8 hours continuing education every two years. To maintain Forensic Interviewer status, the Child Protection Specialist must also participate in the peer review process of their work twice yearly. As a member of an MDT, the Child Protection Specialist shall participate in monthly reviews of their cases. If the Child Protection Specialist not available, the Child Protection Supervisor should attend. To hone skills as part of an MDT, the Child Protection Specialist shall also participate in educational opportunities that are cross-discipline in nature. The Department shall designate a person who will be responsible for formalizing inter-agency agreements and policies across Child Advocacy Centers and MDTs. The Child Protection Specialist shall interview, observe, and thoroughly assess every alleged child victim and any other child subjects individually. If the child is hearing impaired or does not speak English, the method of communication that the child uses shall be employed (e.g., sign language, foreign language interpreter). See Section 300.50(e)(9), Persons with Special Communication Needs. Efforts shall be documented in a contact note. The Child Protection Specialist shall ask each child if there is an extended family member, other adult or caregiver with whom the child feels safe or to whom the child is important or special. The Child Protection Specialist shall conduct an interview with the person(s) identified by the child. The interviews shall focus on the child’s family life, needs, strengths as well as the child’s safety. These interviews shall be documented in a contact note. Note: A positive relationship with a caring, non-abusive adult is a protective factor in the life of a child. Child-selected collaterals can be good candidates to gather information, monitor a safety plan, provide mentorship, keep eyes and ears on the child, and provide a possible placement option. Any knowledge the collateral has concerning the child’s behavior, current situation, family life, needs, strengths and challenges is valuable when determining safety threats. A person whom the child trusts, but who is not the child’s caregiver, the alleged perpetrator or another alleged child victim (e.g., an older sibling) may be present during the interview if it will make the child more comfortable.

All children who are awakened for observation must be undressed. All observations must be documented in a contact note. The Child Protection Specialist shall complete a safety assessment in accordance with Procedures 300.Appendix G, using the Child Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol (CERAP). 5) Observation of the Alleged Victim The Child Protection Specialist shall observe the child if: • The child victim is alleged to have external marks/injuries (e.g., cuts, bruises, welts, burns, scratches, sores, etc.) as the result of abuse or neglect. All children age 6 and under must be awakened and undressed for observation. • For further instructions on the observation of external marks and injuries and how to assess the information gathered from observations, refer to Procedures 300.100, Medical Requirements for Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect. Note: If the child needs to be examined by a medical provider, the Child Protection Specialist shall refer to and comply with the instructions in Procedures 300.100(c)(2), Medical Examinations. A) Observable External Marks/Injuries There should always be a parent/guardian/caregiver or other professional person, preferably of the same sex as the child, present when a Child Protection Specialist observes a child, regardless of the child's age. A Child Protection Specialist shall not observe any part of a child's body that would normally be covered by a bikini bathing suit if the child is age 7 or older unless the Child Protection Specialist is the same sex as the child. If not the same sex as the child, the Child Protection Specialist can attempt to locate someone of the same sex to observe or arrange with a parent to take the child to a physician for observation. Children who are verbal shall be told the purpose of the observation and the necessity for it in words they can understand. If the child is hearing impaired or does not speak English, the method of communication that the child uses shall be employed (e.g., sign language, foreign language interpreter).

procedures-300_102_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 27, 2022, PT 2022.11 E) Alleged Perpetrator Child Protection Specialists are required to interview an alleged perpetrator individually and in person. Care must be taken by the Child Protection Specialist to avoid the appearance of acting as an agent of the police or of giving alleged perpetrators the impression that they are not free to leave the interview. Because Child Protection Specialists are not law enforcement officers, they are not to give Miranda Warnings to alleged perpetrators. (A Miranda Warning is a statement of rights given by law enforcement officers to any suspect in custody before law enforcement can initiate any questioning of the suspect). Issues with the Miranda Warning are most likely to arise with death, physical abuse, and sexual abuse harm allegations that involve joint investigations by DCFS and the police when criminal prosecution is a possibility. In these instances the Child Protection Specialist must make it clear that he/she is not an agent of law enforcement. It may be advisable for law enforcement to conduct or participate in the interview with the alleged perpetrator, in which case law enforcement will determine if it is necessary to give the Miranda Warning to the alleged perpetrator. i) When the Child Protection Specialist conducts the interview with the alleged perpetrator, the following precautions should be taken: • Alleged Perpetrator Not in Police Custody Assure the alleged perpetrator that he or she is free to end the interview at any time. This is especially true for juvenile subjects or those who are emotionally or intellectually handicapped. If it is safe to do so, consider interviewing the alleged perpetrator in the home. The Child Protection Specialist should make clear that he/she is not a law enforcement officer and that his/her task is to determine whether abuse or neglect occurred and to protect children. • Alleged Perpetrator in Police Custody Interviews of subjects in police custody should be conducted in conjunction with law enforcement through a multidisciplinary investigative approach.

Child Protection Specialists shall not request that subjects of an investigation take a polygraph or use polygraph results in making determinations regarding allegations of child abuse or neglect. Subjects who suggest or offer to take a polygraph must be told that polygraphs are not part of Department model or practice. 7) Observation of the Environment The Child Protection Specialist must observe the environment and complete the CFS 2027, Home Safety Checklist. Observations, including photographs, of all relevant environments must be used as evidence to support or negate the abuse or neglect allegation. A scene investigation must be completed.

Gathering evidence is allegation specific and includes, but is not limited to: • verifying the identity of investigation subjects; • completing all person searches and LEADS checks; • directly observing and photographing the child victim’s environment and the child victim(s); • conducting in-person interviews of other subjects of the investigation; • conducting interviews of reporters/sources/other persons with information (OPWI), witnesses; • obtaining pertinent information and documentation from medical experts; • obtaining and documenting descriptive statements from the perpetrator, victim, witnesses, and OPWI; • obtaining and reviewing law enforcement reports and findings; and • obtaining and reviewing (when possible) photographs or other recordings taken by law enforcement or medical professionals. Note: If investigative activities reveal an additional allegation is needed or a more appropriate allegation is needed to replace the allegation originally assigned, the Child Protection Specialist shall identify and assign the most appropriate allegation. Child Protection Specialists shall gather Direct and/or Indirect Evidence to support an investigative finding. An example of Direct Evidence would be a statement given by an eyewitness. Indirect (Circumstantial) Evidence is evidence that infers the existence or nonexistence of certain facts. An example of Indirect (Circumstantial) Evidence is that a child’s caregiver is the perpetrator of abuse when the child is diagnosed with abusive head trauma and is known to have been in the sole care of that caregiver during the timeframe of the alleged incident.

procedures-300_113_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 h) Assessing the Credibility of Evidence For purposes of making child abuse and neglect investigation decisions, “credibility of evidence” means the likelihood that information gathered during the course of a child abuse and neglect investigation is accurate. The Child Protection Specialist and supervisor must evaluate the value and relevance of case information to determine what information is credible and can be used as evidence. 1) Factors Affecting the Credibility of Evidence Obtained from All Sources When determining investigative findings, the credibility of each piece of evidence must be evaluated according to the factors below. The more credible the information, the more weight the information should be given in reaching a final finding. Factors affecting the credibility of evidence include, but are not limited to, the following: A) Corroborating Evidence: Corroborating evidence is evidence that supports someone’s prior statement or other evidence that may point to a certain determination of fact. Evidence is more credible than information that has not been verified or supported by independent sources. Example: a mother’s statement that a physician has seen her child is made far more credible when the physician (corroborating witness) verifies that he or she has seen the child. Another example would be a child’s claim that someone hit him/her on the back with an extension cord, and upon visual inspection you observe linear loop marks on the child’s back (corroborating physical evidence). B) Source of Information: The more direct the source of information that serves as the basis for a source’s opinion, the more reliable is the opinion. Example: a physician rendering an opinion based on a review of medical records is more credible than a physician rendering an opinion based on the description of an injury by the Child Protection Specialist. Even more credible is an opinion rendered by a physician based on her or his direct physical evaluation of the child. C) Direct Interest: Information from a source who has something to lose or gain from a particular investigative outcome may be less credible than information from a source that has no direct interest or bias in providing an account that may not be accurate. Example: a neighbor who has had no previous relationship to a family and who reports that the young children have been left alone is more credible than a neighbor who has been feuding with the family and makes the same report. It should not be surprising that adults named as alleged perpetrators of abuse or neglect would want to present themselves in the best possible light. Evidence of bias should be corroborated whenever possible. Example: a mother’s claim that a grandmother’s allegations against her are suspect should not be presumed to be true just because the mother claims that the grandmother never liked the mother’s boyfriend. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",565,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_114_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 D) Basis of Knowledge: When a witness gives information to a Child Protection Specialist, it is critical to determine the basis of the witness’ knowledge. Example: if a mother claims that her child was injured when her boyfriend accidentally fell on a bed where the child was laying, the Child Protection Specialist should determine whether the mother directly observed the event or was told by the boyfriend how the event occurred. If a physician determines the child’s injury could not have occurred in the manner described, the Child Protection Specialist must decide if the mother can be considered as a trusted source of information. Note: Subjects of a pending child abuse/neglect investigation, who self-report behaviors that may pose safety threats, such as the use of alcohol/drugs or involvement in a relationship where domestic violence is a concern, may deny or minimize their behavior or the behavior of others when interviewed by the Child Protection Specialist. The Child Protection Specialist must seek out additional collaterals to verify self-reports, such as information developed through personal observation, reports from professionals, reports from law enforcement, or required interviews in order to establish the accuracy of self-reports. There is no substitute for independent verification. If collateral information shows a subject has not been truthful, the subject’s credibility must be taken into account when assessing their protective capacity. 2) Factors Affecting the Credibility of Evidence Obtained from Professional Sources Mandated reporters/sources/OPWIs often become aware of issues regarding incidents of alleged child abuse/neglect due to the role their profession plays in the life of an alleged child victim. There is rarely any reason for mandated reporters to lie or falsify information to the Department. However, not all mandated reporters provide equally credible information. Factors that can influence the degree to which a mandated reporter’s information is credible include first-hand observation of the incident of alleged harm, training, experience, and specialization. 3) Factors Affecting the Credibility of Evidence Obtained from Adult Non-Professional Sources The credibility of information obtained from non-professional sources, especially subjects of investigations, must be carefully evaluated. Particular consideration must be given to any direct interest non-professional sources may have in the outcome of an investigation. When weighing the credibility of non-professional sources of evidence, there is no substitute for independent verification of the evidence with additional sources. Factors influencing the degree of credibility of information provided by non-professional sources include, but are not limited to: A) Consistency: Information reported in a consistent manner is more credible than information reported inconsistently. For example, a non-professional source that provides a significantly different description of an incident to a police officer or a physician from the account given to the Child Protection Specialist is less credible than a person whose description of the incident Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",584,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_115_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 remains constant. In order to verify the consistency of any previous obtained statements, it is crucial that the Child Protection Specialist not share information obtained from other sources with a source being interviewed. B) Plausibility: A plausible statement is one that is superficially fair or appearing worthy of belief, but requires further investigation. Example: the statement that a child fell out of bed and bruised his face is plausible, but requires further investigation to determine whether the explanation is a truthful account of what actually happened. Example: a hand-shaped bruise on a child’s face caused by a fall would not be considered to be a plausible explanation for the injury. As a rule, qualified physicians must verify whether explanations given for physical injuries are plausible. 4) Factors Affecting the Credibility of Evidence Obtained from Children The factors in the subsections above and the following should be considered when assessing evidence obtained from children: A) Assessing The Child's Credibility: Factors enhancing the child's credibility include detailed descriptions in the child's own language and from the child's point of view; spontaneity; appropriate degree of anxiety; inclusion of idiosyncratic or sensorimotor detail; consistency of allegations over time (minor details and descriptive terms may change but the child's account of events should remain basically the same); behavioral changes consistent with the abuse; absence of motivation or undue influence for fabrication; and corroborating evidence. The evaluator needs to be aware of the child's cognitive and emotional development and how this may affect the interpretation and the recall of events. B) Evidence That the Child’s Account Of The Facts Has Been Influenced By Others: A child’s information is more credible when the child is interviewed out of the presence of others who have the ability and motivation to coerce, coach or otherwise influence the child’s statement. The Child Protection Specialist and Supervisor should discuss any concerns regarding attempts to influence a child’s statements and the motivation to do such. This discussion should be documented within a supervisory note during the course of regular supervision and again at the time of the final finding determination when assessing all evidence gathered. Child protection staff shall not use their belief that a parent or other person is influencing, coaching or pressuring a child to make a specific statement during the course of a child abuse or neglect investigation as the basis for indicating an allegation of child abuse or neglect. Concerns that a child’s statements may have been influenced should be considered, in addition to all of the other evidence gathered, during the course of a child abuse or neglect investigation in order to make a determination whether to indicate or unfound an allegation and discussed with the Supervisor when making a final finding determination.

procedures-300_116_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 i) Assessment of Case Information and Evidence The Child Protection Specialist and the Child Protection Supervisor must assess the value and relevancy of case information to determine which information will be used as evidence, and which evidence is more or less credible. The Child Protection Specialist and the Child Protection Supervisor must assess the credibility of evidence and identify it as either inculpatory or exculpatory. Inculpatory evidence is evidence showing or tending to show a person’s involvement in or responsibility for an act of abuse or neglect. Exculpatory evidence is evidence tending to show a person’s lack of involvement in or lack of responsibility for an act of abuse or neglect The Child Protection Specialist and Child Protection Supervisor must assess all exculpatory and inculpatory evidence when making an investigative finding. Note: The decision to indicate or unfound an investigation should not be based on whether law enforcement or a medical doctor took protective custody. The Child Protection Supervisor must review the SACWIS and hard-copy files. All information obtained during the investigation and determined to be relevant is to be used as inculpatory or exculpatory evidence to make a determination. It is of critical importance that all evidence suggesting that an incident of abuse or neglect did not occur be given the same consideration as evidence suggesting that an incident of abuse or neglect did occur. The Child Protection Specialist and the Child Protection Supervisor must evaluate each piece of information to determine its relevance, credibility and weight of importance in proving or disproving the pending allegations. The Child Protection Supervisor shall review all inculpatory and exculpatory evidence with the Child Protection Specialist to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe that the incident occurred or that the set of circumstances is or was present. Equal consideration shall be given to all information considered. Assessment of Evidence The following may never be used as the sole basis to unfound or indicate a report. • Intent to Harm the Child: The fact that the perpetrator expresses that he/she did not intend to hurt, leave a mark or endanger a child is not a factor to be considered in making a final finding determination. The law is clear that the showing of intent is not required to prove abuse, but that the abuse occurred by other than accidental means. In reviewing the specific circumstances surrounding an allegation of abuse, the focus must be on whether the caregiver failed to fulfill their responsibility as a caregiver and what happened to the child, not the caregiver’s intent. • One Time Incident: There is nothing in ANCRA that provides for a report to be unfounded solely because an incident of abuse or neglect was a one-time or isolated incident. The incident must be evaluated according to the evidence gathered and the consideration of all applicable factors. Example: It is inappropriate to unfound the case of an infant who was left alone simply because it had not happened before. • The Family’s Need for Services: The decision to indicate a report must be based on evidence and not used as a device to obtain services for a family. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",637,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_117_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 • Agreement or Failure to Accept Services: The fact that a perpetrator agrees to receive or refuse services (or is already receiving them) shall have no effect on the decision to indicate or unfound an allegation. The final determination is based upon the incident that occurred. Services can impact the safety and risk assessments, but not the final finding decision. Example: the investigation of a mother who hit a two-year old in the face with a belt should not be unfounded simply because the mother is receiving anger- management counseling or indicated because she refuses anger-management counseling. • Economic Status or Neighborhood: Child protection decisions must never be influenced by a family’s economic status or by the condition of the neighborhood in which they live. The fact that families are wealthy and live in an affluent neighborhood or poor and live in a disadvantaged neighborhood, should play no part in the decision to indicate or unfound a report. • Attitude Toward the Child Protection Specialist or Other Involved Workers: The attitude family members express toward the Child Protection Specialist must not influence a final finding determination. Reports must never be unfounded because the family is agreeable and cooperative with the Child Protection Specialist, or other involved workers, nor should they be indicated because the family is disagreeable and uncooperative. • Conflicting Information Conflicting information should never be used solely as a basis to unfound or indicate a report. The Child Protection Specialist must determine which statements are more likely to be credible by applying the following factors: o Various family members may have motivation to be untruthful if they will benefit from it. Example: a grandparent may exaggerate a situation because he or she wants custody of the child. Many times relatives want custody because of valid concerns regarding a child’s safety and cannot be presumed to be acting in bad faith. o Whose “story” most closely fits the facts provided by objective witnesses and the Child Protection Specialist’s observations? Which version most closely fits what the Child Protection Specialist already knows to be factual about the case? What set of statements is most plausible? o Is the subject’s statement based upon expertise in an area that he or she makes reference to? Example: an emergency medical technician giving a medical opinion about an incident of sexual abuse would be considered less reliable than the medical opinion of a physician who performed the sexual abuse examination. However, the EMT may be the best source of information on how the child or household appeared when the EMT arrived at the scene. o Is the information provided based upon first-hand knowledge, second-hand hearsay or only the feelings and attitudes of the person being interviewed? A statement made from first hand observation is more likely to be accurate.

procedures-300_118_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 • Personal Biases of the Child Protection Specialist: Child Protection Specialists should be aware of their own personal biases and how those biases affect their decisions. Child Protection Specialists, in consultation with their supervisors, must ensure that their own personal biases do not influence the determination of a final finding. Examples of such personal biases include, but are not limited to, issues of: o Culture; o Race; o Gender; o Sexual orientation; o Religion; or o Ethnic heritage. • Death of a Perpetrator During an Investigation The death of a perpetrator during the course of an investigation should not influence a final finding determination. The final finding must be based on the evidence gathered and whether or not that evidence supports a finding that child abuse or neglect occurred. If there is not sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable person to believe that the incident occurred or that a set of circumstances is or was present, the report shall be unfounded. If there is sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable person to believe that the incident occurred or that a set of circumstances is or was present, the incident or set of circumstances must be compared to the definitions of all relevant allegations and the established standard for indicating them to determine that the report shall be indicated. j) Preliminary Report of the Investigation 1) If the Child Protection Specialist is unable to make a final finding determination within 55 calendar days of the receipt of the report, the Child Protection Specialist must submit a good cause extension request to the Child Protection Supervisor. The Child Protection Supervisor shall review the extension request and if approved, in turn submit the good cause extension request to the Area Administrator, prior to the 55th elapsed calendar day of the investigation. 2) All requests and approvals for extensions must be documented. In the narrative section on the extension request, the Child Protection Specialist shall list the reasons the investigation cannot be completed within 55 days, activities to be completed, who is responsible for completing each activity, and the expected date of completion. The extension request shall be reviewed and approved by the Child Protection Supervisor and Area Administrator. The date and time of the Area Administrator’s approval of additional extensions must be documented in a contact note. There must be information and activities contained within contact and supervisory notes documenting the progress of the investigation and plans for completion.

procedures-300_119_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 3) Good cause for extending the period for making a determination an additional 30 days may include, but is not limited to, the following reasons: • State's Attorneys or law enforcement officials have requested that the Department delay making a determination due to a pending criminal investigation; • Medical autopsy reports, or mental health records needed to make a determination are still pending after the initial 60 day period or there are conflicting medical opinions to resolve; • The report involves an out-of-state investigation and the delay is beyond the Department's control; • Multiple alleged perpetrators or victims are involved necessitating more time in developing evidence and conducting interviews; • The investigation requires analysis of conflicting medical opinions; • Reports requiring a GAL review; or • Reports requiring a DuPuy review; k) Final Determinations 1) When the Child Protection Specialist has completed all required investigative contacts and has gathered all inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, the Child Protection Specialist shall, in consultation with the Child Protection Supervisor, make a final finding determination. This determination shall be based upon whether the evidence gathered during the investigation and from the direct observations made by the Child Protection Specialist constitutes credible evidence of child abuse or neglect. When assessing evidence and direct observation in order to determine a final finding, the Child Protection Specialist should apply the following 6 critical thinking steps: • What information is available? • What am I being asked to believe or accept? • What evidence is available to support the assertion; is it reliable and valid? What evidence is there to negate the assertion? • Are there alternative ways of interpreting the information? • What additional information would help to evaluate the alternatives? • What conclusions are most reasonable based on the information and the number of alternative explanations?

procedures-300_120_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022, PT 2022.07 Note: Investigations shall not be approved for closure when alleged perpetrators have not been interviewed by Child Protection staff, due to a police investigation, without obtaining and reviewing a copy of the police investigation, including interview reports. 2) When the evaluation of all inculpatory and exculpatory evidence leads a reasonable person to believe that an incident of abuse or neglect did occur, the allegation is indicated. 3) When there is evidence that the parent, caretaker, immediate family member, paramour or person responsible for the child’s welfare failed to make reasonable efforts to stop another person from harming a child, the final finding of abuse against the individual should be documented as Indicated Allowed. This is used when the individual had no direct responsibility for the abuse, but the individual’s failure to protect allowed harm to be inflicted. Example: a mother who watches her paramour inflict bruises on her child and makes no effort to intervene would receive a final finding of Indicated Allowed for Allegation #11 Cuts, Bruises, Welts, Abrasions and Oral Injuries. 4) When the evaluation of all inculpatory and exculpatory evidence leads a reasonable person to believe that an incident of abuse or neglect did not occur, the allegation is unfounded. Note: If the recommended finding is to unfound a report, but the parent/caregiver has been arrested and charged on the same facts leading to the child abuse/neglect allegations, an investigation shall not be closed until the criminal court ruling is obtained. 5) Once a final determination has been made and the Child Protection Supervisor has approved the investigation, the investigation can only be re-opened for the exceptions listed below. Note: The Child Protection Specialist and Child Protection Supervisor are NEVER to contact OITS to open a closed investigation. A) An investigation may be re-opened, after approval from the of Deputy of Child Protection, under the following exceptions: • Technical error (i.e., Child Protection Specialist chose a wrong drop- down; Child Protection Supervisor meant to return the investigation but selected approve instead); or • Technical error that does not impact the Final Finding (i.e., removal of a note; correction within a note; failed to complete the protective custody section).

The Child Protection Supervisor shall submit approved requests to the Deputy of Child Protection or designee, Area Administrator, Regional Administrator, and SCR Administrator (the chain of approval must be documented in the request submitted to the Deputy of Child Protection). C) The Deputy of Child Protection or designee shall review and approve or reject the request to re-open an investigation within 24 hours of receipt of the request. If approved, the Deputy of Child Protection or designee shall notify the SCR Administrator to re-open the investigation. The SCR Administrator shall notify the Child Protection Supervisor that the investigation has been re-opened. Note: Once an investigation is completed and a final finding notification letter is sent, a case cannot be reopened. l) Authority to Receive Information and Records When conducting investigations, Child Protection Specialists, Child Protection Supervisors, and Area Administrators are entitled to receive information and records concerning subjects of the investigation and their environments that are relevant to the investigation. This includes medical records. [The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) allows protected health information about a subject of an investigation to be disclosed without written authorization to an appropriate government authority authorized by law to receive reports of child abuse or neglect.] When appropriate, the Child Protection Specialist shall use the CFS 600-5, Request for Records, to communicate the Department’s authority to receive information and records. If the keeper of the records will not release the requested records, the Child Protection Specialist shall issue a CANTS 7, Administrative Subpoena, to obtain the records. 1) Authorization to Use Subpoenas The Children and Family Services Act [20 ILCS 505/21(b)] authorizes qualified Department staff to secure by its subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books and papers relevant to abuse and neglect investigations. 2) When to Use When a Child Protection Specialist has been denied access to information pertinent to an investigation, the Child Protection Specialist shall consult with the Child Protection Supervisor regarding the issuance of an administrative subpoena. The administrative subpoena can be used to obtain access to documents or require appearance of persons to give evidence. The Child Protection Specialist shall ensure that persons with a limited ability to read or understand English, comprehend the subpoena or visually impaired persons shall have the subpoena read to them or translated into Braille. Spanish language forms shall be used for Spanish speaking clients.

All other requests should be made within 24 hours after the need is identified. A) Prior to making a parallel investigation request, the Child Protection Supervisor shall consider the following factors to determine the practicability of having the assigned Child Protection Specialist travel to another RSF to initiate the investigation or complete a contact: • Travel time and distance; • Benefits to the family and Department in maintaining investigation continuity; and • Elimination of the possible need to have a Child Protection Specialist from the other RSF travel to testify in court. B) To make a parallel investigation request, the Child Protection Supervisor shall complete the narrative section in the assignment window describing the reason or reasons for the request, special instructions, updated locations and telephone numbers of subjects to be seen, and forward the request to the appropriate investigative team.

In accordance with the CERAP, the Child Protection Specialist that initiates the in- person contact with the alleged children victims should complete the safety assessment. However, when the parallel Child Protection Specialist initiates contact with the alleged child victims, the Child Protection Specialist and his or her supervisor shall contact the primary Child Protection Supervisor to discuss which Child Protection Specialist shall complete the safety assessment. When there are multiple alleged child victims in more than 3 RSFs, the primary Child Protection Specialist is responsible for completing the safety assessment. When the Child Protection Supervisors disagree about which Child Protection Specialist should complete the safety assessment, the Area Administrators must be consulted. When an agreement cannot be reached, the primary Area Administrator shall make the decision. When a child victim is seen by a Child Protection Specialist during a parallel investigation, and the child has been assessed unsafe and a safety plan has been implemented, it is the responsibility of the parallel team to complete 5-day safety reassessments and related requirements. The parallel team shall also participate in weekly teleconferences with the primary team.

Collateral contacts should be used to verify the identity of those persons unwilling or unable to produce verification of identity. The Child Protection Specialist conducting the parallel investigation shall update this information in the Person Management window. 6) Hard Copy Documentation The Child Protection Specialist conducting the parallel investigation must forward any hard copy information to the primary Child Protection Specialist within 72 hours or sooner after receipt of the document. 7) Parallel Investigations within the City of Chicago Parallel investigation requests are not permitted between investigative teams serving the City of Chicago. The assigned Child Protection Specialist will complete all investigation requirements regardless of where the subject or collateral contact is located in the city. 8) Out-of-State Parallel Investigation Requests When a subject of an investigation resides in another state or an in-person collateral contact is required in another state, the Child Protection Specialist shall contact the appropriate child protection agency in the state where the subject or collateral contact is located to request the parallel investigation contact. Depending on the case circumstances, the request may be made by telephone or in writing. The Child Protection Specialist shall document the request in a contact note. Copies of written correspondence shall be filed in the investigative file. If the agency does not respond in a timely manner with the requested information, the Child Protection Specialist shall contact the agency to determine the reasons, and document the reasons for the delay and actions taken to secure the requested information in a contact note. When appropriate, the Child Protection Specialist shall contact the agency weekly until the information is obtained. The Child Protection Specialist shall consult with the Child Protection Supervisor when the requested information is not received prior to the end of the 60-day final determination time frame in order to determine whether a final finding can be made without the requested information.

procedures-300_135_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 Section 300.60 Scene Investigations and Time Lines a) Scene Investigations Many abuse and neglect allegations require “observation of the environment” or a “scene investigation.” The Child Protection Specialist must conduct a scene investigation when it is required by the allegation being investigated. (Refer to Procedures 300, Appendix B for allegation specific instructions.) Scene investigations can include the observation and assessment of more than one location, depending on the incident of harm. The Child Protection Specialist should consult with the Child Protection Supervisor to determine which environments require a scene investigation. The Child Protection Specialist must contact local law enforcement when it is important to preserve physical evidence from a scene. However, that does not relieve the Child Protection Specialist from the responsibility to carefully and thoroughly describe this evidence in a contact note. The Child Protection Specialist conducts a scene investigation by observing, photographing, and documenting the vicinity and surroundings where an incident of child abuse or neglect is alleged to have occurred. The scene investigation should include: • A description of what is visible or present at the scene. Note the time of day the environment is observed, describe important visible objects and estimate distances. If a distance or height is a crucial fact in an investigation, the Child Protection Specialist should measure it or make arrangements for it to be measured. When an injury shows a pattern (e.g., a striped bruise), look at the scene for an instrument that may have caused that pattern. Example: A baby had a head injury that left a pronounced pattern mark on top of head. Dad admitted having the child in his sole custody during the previous 24 hours, and that he was playing on his PlayStation. The Child Protection Specialist noticed the dimensions of the pattern mark matched perfectly with TV remote control. Dad later admitted throwing the remote at baby. • The Child Protection Specialist shall take photographs of the scene and items located at the scene in accordance with these procedures. If items are needed for physical evidence, the Child Protection Specialist must contact local law enforcement for assistance. When photographing the scene, the Child Protection Specialist shall also ask to photograph a child, caregiver, or witness who is reenacting what he/she did or saw when that photograph would help explain what happened to the child. To be admissible in court or at an administrative hearing, a witness must state that a photograph fairly and accurately portrays the scene. If the scene changed before the photo was taken (e.g., law enforcement removed an object, or parent cleaned the room), the photograph may still be admissible if the Child Protection Specialist, child or any witness can explain the changes between what is depicted in the photograph and the condition of the location when the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",557,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_136_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 witness saw it. Because of this, the Child Protection Specialist should not hesitate to take photographs after a scene has been changed (e.g., “processed” by law enforcement/coroner or cleaned by the family). Witnesses should be asked whether and how the scene is different from the scene at the time of the incident. • Document the presence or absence of any objects, such as furniture or instruments that were alleged to cause an injury. Note the presence of any obstructions (e.g., shrubbery, walls) that may have limited a witness’ ability to view the child or incident. The Child Protection Specialist should ask to see items that may not be visible but are identified to be related to the alleged harm (i.e. an instrument such as a spatula or wooden spoon allegedly used to cause an injury). • In some investigations, the presence or absence of sounds or odors may also be relevant. Note any unexpected or unusual sound, noise or odors (e.g., whether the sound of children playing outside is easily heard inside the home, or the smell of rotting garbage). Scene evidence is an essential component of a thorough investigation. Scene evidence can help the Child Protection Specialist assess the credibility of various explanations of the incident or injury, and to consider other possible explanations/causes. More specifically, written descriptions of the scene are essential to: • Determine and help prove environmental circumstances surrounding the incident (e.g., establish times, distances and visibility.); • Determine how an injury occurred (e.g., instrument or object used to hit a child, a fall against a blunt object, a fall from a height); Example: In a scalding case involving the bathroom sink, view the temperature setting of the hot water heater. When the hot water is turned on in that sink, how quickly does the water get hot? If the sink is metal, does the sink itself get hot? Does the water temperature fluctuate if the toilet flushes or water is turned on elsewhere in the house? The hot water temperature at the site of the burn/scalding incident shall be measured by the Child Protection Specialist as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after he or she has determined reasonable cause. If the subjects refuse to allow the Child Protection Specialist to test the water, the Child Protection Specialist shall request assistance to gain access from the building’s maintenance person, the local building department or law enforcement when law enforcement is involved in the investigation. In accordance with guidelines established by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, water temperature is accurately measured by placing an approved (DCFS issued) thermometer in the stream of hot water that has been running for two minutes, and holding it in the stream until the temperature recorded by the thermometer stops rising. The following index identifies those water Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",589,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf

It is also important to document what happened after an injury or incident, especially how the child and adult(s) responded after an injury or incident. A timeline documenting “who/what/where/when” statements from persons interviewed during an investigation is also useful to compare accounts of events obtained during separate interviews with different sources. This enables the Child Protection Specialist to examine the consistency and credibility of accounts of the events leading up to the injury or incident. A timeline can be helpful when assessing whether an individual’s account of events changes over time, and may provide information about a parent’s or caregiver’s behavior. The Child Protection Specialist should review entries on the timeline to look for critical risk and safety issues (e.g., events that suggest there may be domestic violence, substance abuse, mental health issues) and patterns of parenting or supervision that may require follow-up interviews or need to be addressed in the Family Service Plan. The timeline should document the following information provided by each interviewed individual (when discrepancies exist, the timeline should include each witness’ separate account of the disputed information): 1) The names and relationships of each person (adult or child) who was present with the child, or was aware of the child’s location during that time period; 2) Who was supervising (or responsible for supervising) the child; 3) Any events or evidence of concern to the parents or caregivers, especially related to parenting, or safety/risk factors; 4) When the child first demonstrated symptoms of injury and a description of those symptoms; 5) Each place the child was placed or observed by caregivers during the 24 to 48 hours before the injury occurred, and the approximate time (e.g., “show me where the child was”, “show me the position the child was in”; ask to photograph the caregiver demonstrating how the child was placed). Always ask the interviewee whether the information they provide is from personal knowledge or whether they are providing information that is second-hand; Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",534,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf

How did the child get there? What was the child’s condition? (e.g., describe environmental factors such as traffic and weather conditions, whether the child was dressed appropriately for the season. If the child walked, when appropriate, recreate how the child arrived at the location where he/she was found.) Example: Report from primary care physician states the child suffered a serious head injury. When asked about activity during the past 72 hours, the mother states 2 days ago, when she went to wake the child up in the morning that was the first time she noticed the child fussy and vomiting. She took the child to the Emergency Room (ER) to be checked (the head injury was undetected at the ER) and returned home. Over the next two days, the child continued to be fussy and occasionally vomit, and then became lethargic. Mom took the child to the primary care physician, who called in the report. When making the time line, show the date and approximate time that the mother identified the first symptoms (vomiting, fussy behavior). Have her walk through her morning – where in the house did she sleep that night, and what time did she get up? What did she do prior to going to the child’s room? Ask her to describe both her and the child’s activities the day and night before. Who, besides Mom, had access to the child during that time? Who, besides Mom and the child were in the house overnight? Determine what if any interaction did each person have with the child? Ask Mom what she did during the time after noticing the child was ill until she took the child to the ER.

procedures-300_141_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT October 9, 2015 – PT 2015.23 The Child Protection Specialist should also determine and document: • When and to whom did the child first complain about or show signs of the injury? • Who first noticed a symptom of the injury (e.g., fussiness, crying, lethargy, seizure, vomiting, lack of appetite, etc.)? When did they notice? What exactly did they do in response? • Did the child say how he/she was injured, or describe the incident? (Include an observation of the symptoms for non-verbal children.) • Where was the child when the complaint was made? • If the child was injured, did the person receiving the complaint observe the child’s injury? • The presence or absence of objects, surfaces, furniture described by the child or that may have caused an injury (the Child Protection Specialist should note size, color, texture, hard/soft surfaces, etc., of objects that may have caused injury.) Scene reenactment should be conducted when needed to further assess the credibility of explanations of the injury or incident. The Child Protection Specialist should ask the child, caregiver and witnesses to reenact parts of the timeline, such as the progression of actions and positions of involved subjects and objects at the scene, by using dolls or demonstrations. (e.g., when reenacting a scene involving scalding that occurred when the parent bathed the child, ask to see the tub. Have the parent point to show how deep the water was. Using a doll, ask the parent to show how he/she placed the child in the tub.) If the injury occurred outside of the child’s home, the Child Protection Specialist should determine if there is any chance the incident was captured on a video surveillance camera. Ask law enforcement about outdoor surveillance in public places. For private businesses, ask a security officer, staff member, or owner about the existence of video surveillance. Most businesses will allow the Child Protection Specialist to watch the video feed. The Child Protection Specialist may need to send an Administrative Subpoena to obtain copy of the video. Example: Inadequate supervision report states: “Mom wasn’t supervising the child. The child escaped from the laundromat and got hit by car.” Video was available and showed a non-involved individual opening the door at the laundromat and the child immediately running out. The video showed that, just before door opened, Mom and child were standing together next to a washing machine. The child ran when Mom turned sideways to pick up a detergent bottle.

FROM: Beverly J. Walker, Acting Director EFFECTIVE: Immediately I. PURPOSE The purpose of this model Guide is to issue a comprehensive Model of Supervisory Practice for all Department and Purchase of Service Agency (POS) Intact Family Service, Permanency and Child Protective Services staff. This Model sets out expectations required of Supervisors in each of these direct service areas. This model Guide describes: • a comprehensive model of supervision applicable to all DCFS/POS Intact Family Service, Permanency and Child Protective Services staff; • the four functions of supervision (administrative; developmental; supportive; and clinical); and • expectations for the framework and format of supervision. II. PRIMARY USERS The primary users of this model Guide are All DCFS & POS Intact Family Service Workers, Permanency Workers, Child Protective Services Workers, and their Supervisors, Managers and Administrators. III. BACKGROUND Currently, the roles of direct service supervisors are addressed in: • Procedures 300.70, Role of the Child Protection Supervisor; • Procedures 302.388(f), Responsibilities of the Assigned Intact Family Services Supervisor; and • Procedures 315.300, Role of the Permanency Supervisor.",306,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_154_text,"This Model of Supervisory Practice expands these existing Procedures in order to address a “deficient audit finding” in the area of supervision identified during the Council on Accreditation (COA) Interim Review (completed October, 2017). The Department’s Model of Supervisory Practice provides a context for supervision in which the Department’s values, philosophy and structure for conducting child welfare practice is supported by Best Practice principles, model, and training for the purposes of achieving the Department’s Mission: • To protect children who are reported to be abused or neglected and to increase their families' capacity to safely care for them; • To provide for the well-being of children in our care; • To provide appropriate, permanent families as quickly as possible for those children who cannot safely return home; • To Support early intervention and child abuse prevention activities; and • To work in partnerships with communities to fulfill this Mission. The Model of Supervisory Practice also reflects the components of the Department’s Family-Centered, Trauma-Informed, Strength-Based Child Welfare Practice Model. This Child Welfare Practice Model supports race-informed practice and strives to improve the outcomes for children of color by reducing and/or eliminating race-based disproportionality and disparities in practice. IV. MODEL OF SUPERVISORY PRACTICE In the context of child welfare practice, “supervision” describes a formal, agreed-upon process of professional support and learning that enables subordinate practitioners to develop knowledge and competence. Supervision allows the supervisee (subordinate practitioner) to assume responsibility for his or her own practice, with the intended goal providing enhanced services for the service recipient. Good supervision should assist and enable a supervisee to meet Department objectives. The Department’s commitment to accountability and effectiveness has impacted the focus of child welfare practice. Supervisors play a pivotal role in ensuring safety, permanency and well-being for children and families involved in the child welfare system. They are responsible for ensuring effective service delivery and are accountable for achieving the desired outcomes of safety, permanency and well-being for children and families in consideration of the child’s sense of time. Supervisors are not only required to manage change - they must lead change. Direct service supervisors are expected to provide the guidance, development and support required for direct service staff to carry out the Department’s mandate. Administrative and management personnel are responsible to support the work of the direct service supervisor and direct service staff. All administrative and management staff must be cognizant of how their actions and responsibility impact direct service supervisors, direct service workers, and the children and families they serve.",511,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_155_text,"a) Overview of the Model of Supervisory Practice The Model of Supervisory Practice seeks to ensure that the duties and boundaries of supervision are clear and that Supervisors have up-to-date knowledge of legislation; national and state policies; data and research relevant to child welfare that promote the safety, permanency and well-being for children served by the Department. Model of Supervisory Practice Tenets and Approach 1) Excellence. Each DCFS/POS direct service employee has a duty to strive for and achieve excellence in job performance and service provision. Striving beyond the minimum-required compliance allows direct service staff to focus on the needs of children and families and tailor services to meet their individualized needs in a timely manner. 2) Accountability. Professional accountability is a key element of protecting children and strengthening families. There are multiple facets to accountability in a supervisory role. • First and foremost, Supervisors are accountable to the children and families they serve. They are responsible for ensuring the safety, timely permanency and well-being of children in care, and that the services provided minimize the impact of trauma on children and families while children are in care. • Supervisors are accountable to the Department’s Mission and policies, as well as standards set out by federal, state, and accrediting bodies. • Supervisors are accountable to their subordinate staff. They provide leadership, administrative oversight, and clinical guidance and support so their staff are best able to effectively do their jobs. • Supervisors are accountable to themselves. Direct service supervisors generally hold their positions because they are dedicated to improving the lives of children and families. Their internal measure of their job performance may be the factor that most significantly affects how they carry out their job responsibilities on a daily basis. They hold themselves accountable for ensuring the highest standard of service delivery. • Supervisors are accountable to their peers. Through their leadership and actions, supervisors positively impact the culture of their agency and the office in which they work by interacting in a positive and supportive manner with their other supervisors.",401,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_156_text,"3) Evidence-Informed Practice. This Model of Supervisory Practice is based on evidence-informed practice. Evidence-informed practice involves questioning and assessing the way that child welfare is currently done, and seeking additional research, information, resources, and interventions to guide practice that is ethically and culturally appropriate. It is a process for doing work in a strategically sound way. Evidence- informed practice seeks to produce the same level of stringency as evidence-based practice; however, because research is not always readily available, other valuable resources may be used as part of the evidence- based movement. These are concrete steps leading in the direction on the road to evidence based practice. 4) Race-Informed ‐Practice. Race-informed practice is a method of viewing and serving families of color which takes into account implicit bias and the dynamics of institutional racism as child welfare professionals and other system stakeholders develop model, make decisions about, and provide services. 5) Agency Culture. Supervisors are in a unique position to have a significant influence on agency culture. Supervisors have a responsibility to model and support a culture of respect with children and families, foster and adoptive parents, staff, peers, colleagues, administration and the community. b) Vision Statement for Department’s Child Welfare Practice Model The Department supports a Family-Centered, Trauma Informed, and Strength- Based Child Welfare Practice Model. The Vision of the Practice Model is to identify, intervene, and mitigate the effects of adverse and traumatic experiences of children served by the Department and to build parental capacity by focusing on family and individual strengths. This Vision also continues with efforts to prevent or alleviate secondary trauma experienced by Department/POS direct service staff. c) Core Values, Principles and Standards of Family-Centered, Child-Focused, Trauma-Informed and Strength-Based Practice The Department’s practice principles are family-centered, child-focused, strength- based and trauma-informed. Each of these principles is described below. 1) Family-Centered and Child-Focused Practice. Family-centered practice is a way of working with the family, both formally and informally, across service systems to enhance the family’s capacity to care for and protect the child. It focuses on the child’s safety and needs within the context of the family and community and builds on family strengths to achieve optimal outcomes. Family is defined broadly to include birth, blended, kinship, foster and adoptive families and fictive kin.",488,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_157_text,"Family-centered practice: • strengthens, enables, and empowers the family to protect and nurture the children; • safely preserves family relationships and connections when appropriate; • recognizes the strong influence that social systems have on individual behavior; • enhances family autonomy; • recognizes the family’s right to define who they consider family; • respects the rights, values, religious beliefs and culture of the family; and • focuses on the entire family rather than select individuals within the family. The family unit, including the child as an individual and continuing member, is the focus of intervention. The child remains a member of the family even while living in substitute care. Family-centered intervention looks to the extended family members and relatives, not only as caregivers for the family’s child, but also as supporters of the family in their work toward reunification. Through visitation and shared parenting, committed extended family members and relatives provide a wealth of opportunities to support the parents while keeping the child attached as a family member. The family must be an active participant in all assessment, intervention, review, evaluation and decision processes. Through individual contact with the parents and Child and Family Team Meetings (that may include extended family members and relatives), direct service staff provide: • engagement, full disclosure and ongoing feedback; • open, inclusive and frequent planning; • immediate response to the crisis of placement; and • review and evaluation of progress toward reunification or an alternative permanency goal. Family-centered practice provides an opportunity for the family to discuss their progress, casework support, clinical intervention and the effectiveness of the services provided.",313,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_158_text,"2) Strength-Based Practice. A key to implementing strength-based practice is to begin identifying and documenting observable strengths that can serve to support the family in achieving their goals for safety, permanency and well-being. All families have strengths and needs. Most parents want to resolve the problems and issues that confront them, and they want to be as effective as possible in their role as parents. Most families have had some success at solving past problems. Drawing on successful experiences helps identify skills already available within the family and gives the family hope for the future. Most families can be guided to draw upon their strengths and resources to resolve the problems and issues confronting them and will be able to engage in some or all of the services needed. Direct service staff must document the family’s identified strengths and discuss openly how the family can use and build upon those strengths to support positive change. This discussion should occur on an ongoing basis and be shared with the family as part of full disclosure regarding case progression and family prognosis in support of permanency for all children in the family. 3) Trauma-Informed Practice. The Department has stated the following vision for a trauma-informed practice model: The vision of the practice model is to identify, intervene, and mitigate the effects of adverse and traumatic experiences of children who are entering protective care or currently living in a substitute care placement. This vision also continues with efforts to reduce, if not alleviate, secondary trauma experienced by children while living in out-of-home care. (DCFS Strategic Plan for Trauma, 2007) A child’s reaction to traumatic stress: • may have both short- and long-term consequences for the child’s mental and physical health; • may adversely impact the child’s ability to protect himself/herself from abuse; • may have both short- and long-term consequences for the child’s life trajectory; and • can adversely impact the child’s stability in placements. The need for placement as a safety intervention must be balanced against the trauma of removal and prolonged separation from the family with whom the child shares membership, tradition and identity. The child’s attachment to his/her family, even in the face of maltreatment, is critical to the child’s emotional security.",440,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_159_text,"V. Functions of Supervision There are four interwoven functions of supervision: • administrative; • developmental; • supportive; and • clinical. These functions should be in balance over time, even though one or the other may be more in evidence. If this balance is not achieved and one function (e.g., administrative) is emphasized at the expense of the other three, supervision can become a cold management tool. Similarly, if the supportive function is emphasized, the boundaries between supervision and counseling may become blurred. An overarching function of supervision is to build and maintain relationships, including relationships with supervisees, peers, administrators, families, colleagues in the organization, and community partners. Building and maintaining these relationships provide a framework for each of the functions of supervision described below. a) Administrative Supervision Administrative supervision focuses on promoting high standards of work and adherence to rules, policies, and procedures. Administrative supervision involves the supervisor’s ability to effectively manage the supervisee’s workload to achieve desired outcomes for children and families. Effective supervision requires workload standards that are manageable and in compliance with Council on Accreditation standards, federal and state requirements, as well as Department policies. Supervisors act as a vehicle to assist communication up and down the chain of command, and serve to link the supervisee to the agency. This communication may be about agency developments, changes or new policies interpreting and enforcing procedures, briefing agency management about resource deficits, advocating on behalf of the team or individual supervisee and encouraging positive intra- and inter-agency relationships. Responsibilities in administrative supervision include but are not limited to: • Establishing objectives and priorities within the team that reflect the Department’s Strategic Plan, agency policies, federal and state laws and consent decrees; • Explaining the rationale supporting policies and procedures and the agency’s Mission and Child Welfare Practice Model; • Supervising field placements and internships to attract qualified staff; • Summarizing and evaluating data to identify problems and trends for team planning and achieving outcomes; and • Knowing and complying with laws and policies related to fair hiring and selection processes.",412,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_160_text,"b) Developmental Supervision The fundamental component of developmental supervision is anchored in life- long professional learning. It is the supervisor’s role to create a learning environment, to continue the learning on the job after traditional classroom or online learning, and to use individual and group supervision to foster continued growth and professional development. The most basic component of developmental supervision is on-the-job training and coaching to ensure the transfer of learning from classroom to the field, including both college or university classrooms and the Department training classroom. Research indicates that without continual reinforcement, students retain only about 15% of what they learn in the classroom. Through modeling, coaching and reinforcement, the skills learned in the classroom become integrated into a worker’s daily practice. In the quest for excellence, supervisors must help their staff strive for excellence. This includes identifying and building on staff strengths and providing learning opportunities so that staff can reach their full potential. Additionally, supervisors shall work with their supervisees to complete ongoing strength-based staff performance evaluations accordance with agency model. Recognizing that staff turnover occurs and promotional opportunities become available, succession planning is necessary at all levels. Supervisors assist staff in developing skills necessary to move up in their careers and continue to carry out the Department’s Mission. Learning from one’s experiences in child welfare is a significant factor that helps prevent or alleviate secondary trauma, to which direct service staff are exposed. The supervisor is responsible to assist supervisees in learning from their experiences in child welfare, thereby recognizing the risk of secondary trauma in the workforce and taking action to prevent or alleviate the trauma. Responsibilities in developmental supervision include, but are not limited to: • Evaluating and monitoring the quality, quantity and timeliness of staff performance; • Providing frequent, timely and specific feedback to keep staff apprised of their performance; • Providing a written performance evaluation of staff a minimum of once per year; • Preparing new staff for foundational training and providing activities to aid in the transfer of learning from classroom to the field; • Assessing the knowledge, skills and learning styles of new staff; • Assessing with staff their personal and professional goals and assisting staff in finding and utilizing educational opportunities; • Encouraging development of specialized expertise and innovation on new projects staff may embrace; • Encouraging staff creativity and innovation in new projects and roles;",461,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_161_text,"• Encouraging staff to serve on relevant committees to broaden their perspective; • Supporting staff in their efforts to obtain positions of greater responsibility and to make other needed transitions; and • Working with staff to develop and maintain a professional development plan. c) Supportive Supervision An effective supervisor is one whose staff are supported to maximize their potential. A supervisor is responsible for the maintenance of harmonious working relationships between staff members and other teams and functions in the Department. A supervisor needs to focus on staff morale and job satisfaction, and attend to vicarious trauma and to the high risk of burnout in the child welfare field. Supportive supervision is not therapy or counseling, but recognizes the critical role that feelings and emotions play in direct service staff’s ability to successfully carry out their work. In some cases, supportive supervision may identify the need for counseling independent of supervision. Clearly, this is a very important function; however, it must be kept in balance with the others. Responsibilities of supportive supervision include, but are not limited to: • Acknowledging effective performance, staff efforts, client progress, accomplishments and individual contributions; • Creating and modeling high standards of practice and motivating staff to meet those standards; • Acknowledging that we work with families who experience trauma and this work has traumatic effects on both clients and staff; • Being attuned to one’s own needs and practice self-care; • Supporting staff in self-care; • Treating staff with genuineness, empathy and respect; • Supporting a climate of trust and openness that promotes personal and professional growth; • Creating an environment in which cultural and other differences are respected and appreciated; • Referring staff to employee assistance or other services when identified; • Using mistakes and challenges as opportunities to teach and learn; • Promoting a “can-do” attitude for staff; • Assisting staff in professionally managing conflict; • Seeking supervision and consultation to enhance one’s own effectiveness; • Increasing awareness of how one’s life experiences and cultural background can impact the supervisor/supervisee relationship; • Helping staff identify their own biases and the impact of biases on service delivery; and • Exhibiting flexibility and accepting change in a positive manner.",437,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_162_text,"d) Clinical Supervision Clinical supervision is the provision of guidance designed to support the work that direct service staff do with children and families. During clinical supervision, family engagement, assessment and service provision of cases are reviewed in relation to safety, timely permanency and well-being. Decisions are made regarding how to facilitate the desired goals for change in families in order to best achieve timely outcomes. Clinical supervision also reinforces positive social work ethics and values, encourages self-reflection and critical thinking skills, builds upon training to enhance performance, and supports direct service staff through day-to-day casework practice and decision-making. Responsibilities in clinical supervision include, but are not limited to: • Using sound professional judgments to make case decisions and promote evidence-based and evidence-informed practice; • Assessing and considering direct service workers’ skills, strengths, interests, areas of needed development and the client’s strengths and needs in assigning cases; • Assisting staff in case assessment, including identifying strengths, needs and safety issues, the dynamics of child abuse and neglect contributing to the underlying needs and safety issues, and the strategies for intervention and development of the plan with the family; • Assisting and teaching staff the effective clinical application of assessment tools as they relate to individual children and families; • Increasing staff awareness of how their own attitudes and approaches, life experiences and cultural background potentially impact the relationship with the client and the outcome of intervention; • Assisting staff in assessing progress towards case goals; • Supporting staff in making critical case decisions regarding safety, permanency and well-being; • Encouraging staff to identify and respect the cultural diversity of all families and helping staff develop plans to address individual differences; • Accompanying each worker in the field once per quarter and provide structured feedback; • Helping the supervisee explore any emotional blocks to their work; and • Assessing the supervisee in dealing with job stresses and secondary trauma.",379,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_163_text,"VI. Objectives of Supervision The objectives of supervision are to ensure that: • Clinical practice protects and promotes the Illinois Child Welfare Model of Practice; • Supervision reflects an ethos of equality, embraces diversity and promotes anti- oppressive practice; • Race-informed practice is developed so that the supervisor and supervisee are culturally aware and responsive to each other, their clients, the community and other professionals. • The voices of the child and family are included and evidenced as part of the supervisory process; • Sound professional judgments are made, and evidence-informed, evidence-based and race-informed practices are promoted; • Practice will reflect state and national strategies and legislation on protecting children and will be consistent with Department policies; • Supervision will be carried out in a reflective manner and provide a safe environment where attitudes and feelings may be challenged or explored as necessary; • Clarity and objectivity in relation to the presenting issues are achieved in order to ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of the child; • Staff fully understands their roles and responsibilities. The process of supervision will be underpinned by the principle that each staff member remains accountable for his or her own professional practice and that the supervisor is accountable for the advice he or she gives and decisions made; • Supervision will provide a process of professional learning and support to enable staff to develop and enhance knowledge and competencies; and • Supervision will provide a process to identify individual training needs, and any areas of practice where improvements can be made.",301,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_164_text,"VII. Framework for Supervision a) Individual Supervision. Individual supervision is required to be provided to each direct service worker and non-direct service staff on a weekly basis. Individual supervision should include administrative, developmental, clinical and supportive supervision. Case-related supervision shall be documented in SACWIS case notes as required in Department procedures. A supervisor shall document supervision that is not case-related in the supervisory file, including the date and duration of the meeting and a brief summary of what was discussed. b) Group Supervision. Group supervision is a process where team members come together in an agreed-upon format to share skills, experience and knowledge in order to improve both individual and group capacities. Group supervision is required to be held with the entire team a minimum of once per month. Group supervision should address administrative, developmental, supportive, and clinical supervision. A supervisor shall document group supervision in the supervisory file, including the date and duration of the meeting and a brief summary of the topics discussed and presented in group supervision/team meetings. Note: Managers and administrators should regularly monitor that case-specific supervision, non-case related supervision and group supervision are conducted and properly documented on a routine basis. VIII. Format for Supervision a) Uninterrupted (Protected) Time. Supervisors should ensure that the time slot identified for each individual’s supervision is protected from interruptions and distractions. b) Planned and Scheduled Supervision. Both individual and group supervision should be scheduled in a regular, consistent manner, giving both the supervisor and staff ample time to ensure that they are prepared and available. IX. Functions and Job Responsibilities of Supervisees in Relation to Supervision Supervisees also have a responsibility in the supervisor-supervisee relationship. Among the responsibilities of the supervisee are the following: • Actions agreed upon should be completed within agreed or required timeframes; • Supervision is critical and this time should be protected; • Be prepared for the supervision session; • Supervision that is not case-related will include the identification of critical operational issues, professional development, training, assignments, and follow- up on previous instruction; • Case-specific supervision will include cases to be discussed, with a brief historical summary, outlining the current safety and risk factors, concerns, protective factors and follow up on previous case instruction;",458,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_165_text,"• Record case related supervision and actions agreed upon in SACWIS; • The supervisee is responsible for ensuring all follow-up actions; • The supervisee has a responsibility to raise with the supervisor those instances when the supervisee is not able to fulfill agreed-upon or required actions; and • The supervisee has a responsibility to foster a healthy and collaborative relationship with the supervisor and team.

If during the course of an investigation of a Facility Report the Child Protection Specialist identifies additional perpetrators, the Child Protection Specialist shall contact SCR to have a sequence added to the facility’s SCR number for each additional perpetrator identified and the child each perpetrator is alleged to have abused or neglected. This requirement sometimes necessitates listing children as alleged victims in more than one report. Note: Reports involving foster homes are an exception and may list multiple perpetrators in a single report sequence. • The Department investigates reports on youth between ages 18-22 living in a DCFS licensed residential facility, whether or not they are a ward.

Coordination with law enforcement and Child Advocacy Centers (CAC) is critical for ensuring that forensic interviews are conducted and to appropriately limit the number of times a child victim is interviewed. B) Assessing the Risk of Harm to Other Potential Victims If the initial interview with a ward who is an alleged child victim produces evidence to support a good faith report of abuse or neglect, or if the result of the initial interview is inconclusive, arrangements shall be made to interview other children in the facility with whom the alleged perpetrator has had contact. Each child shall be interviewed individually and in person in a neutral setting, whenever possible. Note: If the Child Protection Specialist determines the alleged perpetrator of a report is running an unlicensed daycare home, the safety of all children in the home must be assessed.

Each SOR has its own separate investigative time frames and final finding determinations. If information obtained during an investigation provides reasonable cause to believe that other children have been abused or neglected in the past, or are currently at risk of harm by a perpetrator for whom there is a pending investigation, the newly identified victim(s) shall be added to the pending investigation provided the harm is related to the same incident or set of circumstances. If the newly identified victim(s) suffered harm or is at risk unrelated to the pending investigation, the newly identified victim shall be the subject of a SOR of the pending investigation. The notification of new reports that is made to the local law enforcement agency and/or the Illinois State Police, Division of Criminal Investigation, shall be handled as per subsection (b) (2) above.

A person shall qualify as a career entrant only if, at the time of notice of investigation, that person (1) has applied or will apply, within 180 days, for a position as a child care worker; (2) is enrolled in or will commence, within 180 days, an academic program which leads to a position as a child care worker; or (3) has applied for a license as a child care worker. “Child care workers” means those persons who work directly with children, or owners/operators of facilities regardless of whether the facility is licensed by the Department of Children and Family Services. Types of facilities and persons that work with children include: • Child care institutions; • Child welfare agencies; • Day care/night care centers; Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",467,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf

Child care workers may also include persons employed in one of the above settings or persons seeking employment, enrolled in an academic program or applying for a license for a child care position who are alleged to be responsible for child abuse or neglect outside of their employment. If the investigation pertains to an alleged perpetrator’s personal life but the alleged perpetrator is employed as a child care worker in one of the above settings, the alleged perpetrator must request that the investigation be treated as an employment related investigation. The Child Protection Specialist shall not base child care worker status on whether the child care worker is represented by a union or whether the child care worker’s employment is the main source of income. School employees, including school aides and bus drivers, shall be considered child care workers, unless they are tenured. Persons who work more than 15 hours a week in a child care position shall be considered to be child care workers. 2) Determining Child Care Worker Status for Non-Facility Reports i) During the course of an investigation that is not coded as a Facility Report, should it become obvious to the Child Protection Specialist that the alleged perpetrator works in a facility or position where he/she has direct contact with children through the course of his/her work, the alleged perpetrator shall be considered a child care worker. For example: Should the Child Protection Specialist interview an alleged perpetrator in a home setting and notice that the home has a state license or that the alleged perpetrator provides care for children, the Child Protection Specialist shall consider that person to be a child care worker. Child care licenses and owners and operators of child care facilities shall be treated as child care workers regardless of licensure and compliance with state law.

There are various ways to determine if a person works in a position in which they have direct contact with children and should be considered a child care worker. Examples of how child care worker status is determined include, but shall not be limited to: • A Child Protection Specialist interviewing an alleged perpetrator in their home setting and observes other children present or objects present that would indicate the alleged perpetrator provides care for children in their home. Where there are obvious signs that an individual cares for children in a home setting, the Child Protection Specialist should consider the alleged perpetrator to be a child care worker and continue the investigation as a DuPuy case. • A Child Protection Specialist may interview an alleged perpetrator who is alleged to have abused or neglected their biological children and who, during the course of the interview, states that they work at a day care center or other position where they have direct contact with children and that they want to be treated as a child care worker. In such situations, the Child Protection Specialist shall document the perpetrator’s information in a contact note and continue the investigation as a DuPuy case. The Child Protection Specialist should immediately contact the Child Care Worker Administrator to complete the documentation denoting the investigation as a DuPuy case. • A Child Protection Specialist may interview an alleged perpetrator who is alleged to have abused or neglected their biological children and during the course of the interview the alleged perpetrator states that they work in a position in which they have direct contact with children such as a day care center or other position where they have direct contact with children, but the alleged perpetrator does not specifically indicate they want to be treated as a child care worker. In such a situation, the Child Protection Specialist should ask the alleged perpetrator about his or her direct contact with children during the course of his employment for the specific purpose of determining whether the person is a child care worker and the investigation should be considered a DuPuy case.

The CFS 370-6 will also inform the family of their right to appeal the Department’s decision and how to file a service appeal. A copy of the CFS 370-6 shall be placed in the case record. 4) Department of Human Services (DHS) Norman Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) Application Program (DHS-NAP) DHS-NAP allows families with children in Department care to apply for TANF benefits and food stamps within 90 days of the expected date that their children will be returned home. DHS-NAP also allows families receiving TANF benefits to retain those benefits if their children are in care, but are expected to be in care less than 90 days. DHS-NAP is only for Norman-certified families who are currently receiving or would otherwise be eligible to receive TANF, if their children were with them. To apply for this program, the Child Protection Specialist must complete a CFS 370-8, DCFS Referral to the Illinois Department of Human Services for the Norman TANF Application Program and submit the form to the Child Protection Supervisor. An authorized Department supervisor or a Norman Liaison must make the final approval and forward the form to the DHS-NAP Liaison. The following information must be entered on the form for cases involving children taken into protective custody: • Parent/guardian’s name and birth date; • Names and birth dates of the children taken into protective custody; • The address where the family resides or will be residing; and • The DHS case number.

Each family may receive only one 90-day extension. e) Special Factors to be Considered The Child Protection Specialist should determine, based on a review and consideration of all the evidence gathered during the investigation, whether protective custody should be taken in the following circumstances, which involve special circumstances. Even if the special circumstances exist, the Child Protection Specialist must ensure that the legal requirements for taking protective custody have been satisfied. 1) Immediately Dangerous Situation The Child Protection Specialist should consult with their supervisor to determine if police assistance is needed. Immediately dangerous situations could include those situations where the alleged perpetrator has access to the: A) alleged child victim; B) alleged child victim who is non-verbal or unable to protect themselves; or C) alleged child victim and the parent or guardian is not willing to believe or protect the child. 2) Injury to an Infant Age 6 Months or Younger The Child Protection Specialist must consider the evidence gathered during the investigation, including: • Direct observation of the infant to determine the infant’s mobility; • Any professional’s direct observation of the infant’s mobility; • Any collateral’s direct observation of the infant’s mobility; • All possible times when the infant could have received the injury and who was providing supervision of the infant during all possible times when the infant could have received the injury; and • Any medical opinion regarding the cause of injury.

In an emergency situation, approval must be sought immediately after protective custody is taken and the child is no longer in immediate danger of being harmed; • Contact the local law enforcement agency for assistance, if necessary to assure the safety of the Child Protection Specialist and the child; • Make every reasonable attempt to notify the child's parent, guardian or legal custodian, including the use of interpreters for limited/non-English speaking or hearing impaired persons. If the parent/guardian is in the home when the child is taken into protective custody, the parent/guardian shall be given the Parent Handbook, CFS 1050-73, Substitute Care and Your Child.

procedures-300_244_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022 – PT 2022.07 g) Sibling Groups The following procedures address the importance of encouraging and maintaining relationships among siblings, whether siblings are now or have ever been involved with the Department. 1) Siblings Defined “Siblings” are children who have at least one parent in common. Children are still considered siblings after parental rights have been terminated, after one or more siblings have been adopted, or after one or more siblings have been placed in guardianship, when the sibling(s) were in DCFS care under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act immediately prior to the adoption or guardianship. Step-siblings may be considered siblings when the children enter into substitute care together and have a positive relationship. For placement purposes, step- siblings who enter care together shall be placed together initially, and continued joint placement shall be re-evaluated after the Integrated Assessment. All efforts are to be made to place siblings together, however, in some instances the members of a sibling group may be in several different living arrangements. The Child Protection Specialist shall include all siblings in the Visitation and Contact Plan, regardless of their living arrangements, if the siblings become known to the Child Protection Specialist before handoff to the Permanency Worker. Living arrangements may include a child: • living in an intact family; • living in substitute care, including out of state placement; • in an ILO/TLP, Youth in College, or Placement Alternative Contract living arrangement; • long-term hospitalization; • residing in a group home or residential placement; • who has been adopted (even when birth siblings are not adopted together, or when one or more siblings remain in care*); • who is under legal guardianship (even when birth siblings are not in guardianship together or when one or more siblings remain in care*) • who is emancipated; or • who has attained adulthood.

procedures-300_245_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022 – PT 2022.07 2) Maintaining Sibling Relationships The Department recognizes the importance of maintaining sibling relationships in those situations when children must be placed away from their parents. For many children, separation from their siblings causes stress, separation anxiety and loss comparable to that caused by separation from parents. In families where parental functioning has broken down, siblings often compensate by relying on one another, meeting each other's dependency needs and providing emotional support. When placed together or, at the very minimum, allowed frequent contact and visitation, siblings can provide at least one predictable element in a stressful situation, as well as providing an important link with the past. For additional information and instruction, staff should reference Procedures 300.Appendix F, Casework Responsibilities in Minimizing the Effects of Separation and Loss in Substitute Care. The initial placement decision can prove to be critical in the life of a case. When a sibling group must be removed from their home, the Department should do everything in its power to place the children together in substitute care. The Child Protection Specialist shall place siblings together whenever possible unless it is in their best interests to place them apart pursuant to Procedures 301.70, a court has ordered that the children be placed apart, or after a diligent search, the Child Protection Specialist is unable to locate a joint placement for the siblings. The Child Protection Specialist shall: • Select a foster family or relative caregiver (licensed or unlicensed) or fictive kin who can accept all the children for placement. This may require the Child Protection Specialist to initiate a diligent search for family members or a licensed foster family home that will accept all the children. Staff should reference Procedures 301.70(c) Diligent Search Upon Initial Placement for information and instruction for diligent search requirements when placing sibling groups; • The Child Protection Specialist shall ask the parents, other caregivers, relatives, and children to identify placement resources and positive supports for the child. The Child Protection Specialist shall document all relatives identified by the family on the CFS 458-B, PART I: Family Composition/Initial Family Finding/Household Income and PART II: Relative Resources and Positive Supports Worksheet. (See Procedures 301.80, Relative Home Placement) • Place step-siblings together when they initially enter care together (the assigned Permanency Worker will re-evaluate continued joint placement after the Integrated Assessment); and • Identify relative caregivers or foster family homes who will support frequent sibling contact and visitation, when siblings or step-siblings must be separated. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services",528,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf
procedures-300_246_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022 – PT 2022.07 An unrelated foster home that will accept the entire sibling group shall be given higher priority over a relative who wants to care for only part of the sibling group, unless extraordinary circumstances exist. Example: If prior to entering care, a sibling group had informally been cared for by two maternal aunts and the children had regular and frequent contact at family functions, church, etc., it may be in the children’s best interest to continue living with the two aunts than to be moved to a non-relative home. Deciding whether children shall be placed apart from siblings who are also placed in substitute care is a critical decision. The Child Protection Specialist must play an active role in the placement decision-making process. Supervisory consultation and approval is required for a decision to place siblings apart. The Child Protection Specialist shall document in a contact note and in the Visitation and Contact Plan the efforts made to find a joint placement and, if the siblings are placed apart, the basis of the decision to do so. The Child Protection Supervisor shall document the basis for that decision in a supervision note. If the basis for separation is pursuant to subsection (e)(1) or (e)(2) of Rule 301.70 Sibling Placement, the Child Protection Specialist shall obtain input from the Department’s Clinical Services division within one business day of the placement decision. The Child Protection Specialist shall ensure that each member of the sibling group receives the DCFS publication CFS 1050-95, How to Connect With Your Brothers and Sisters. 3) Add-Ons Efforts to place siblings together shall apply even when children come into the Department’s care after other siblings have been adopted or placed in private guardianship. The Child Protection Specialist shall determine, in consultation with the child's parents, whether it would be in the child's best interests to explore placement with the adopted sibling, sibling in guardianship, or emancipated sibling who is at least 21 years of age. If the Child Protection Specialist determines it is in the child's best interest to explore the placement, the Child Protection Specialist shall contact the adoptive parent or guardian of the sibling or emancipated sibling to determine whether they are willing and able to be considered as a placement resource for the child and to determine whether it is in the best interests of the child to be placed in the home with the sibling. The Child Protection Specialist shall request a waiver of home capacity for the purpose of bringing additional siblings into the home of a sibling already in placement, when such a request is in the child’s best interests.

procedures-300_247_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022 – PT 2022.07 Note: Placement of a child with his/her sibling who has been adopted or in subsidized guardianship is considered a relative placement. The family home is not required to be licensed to accept immediate placement of these children. If the family is licensed and the license has expired, they should be encouraged to apply for licensure after the additional children have been placed. For children who were adopted and have been subsequently returned to the temporary custody or guardianship of the Department, a ""relative"" may include any person who would have qualified as a relative under this definition prior to the adoption. The Child Protection Specialist and Child Protection Supervisor must determine that it would be in the best interests of the child to consider such person as a relative. h) Protective Custody in Special Cases 1) Custody of Substance Exposed Newborns Child Protection Specialists shall not request that hospitals postpone discharge of infants who are medically ready for discharge. Child Protection Specialists are to advise hospitals that if they keep a baby beyond the number of medically-needed days allowed by DHS, that DCFS will not pay for the extra days of care unless the Child Protection Specialist takes the child into protective custody and the child remains hospitalized for medically required care. The Child Protection Specialist shall not take substance exposed infants into protective custody or accept a voluntary placement agreement just because the mother used illegal drugs during her pregnancy. For protective custody of a substance exposed infant to be taken there must be other circumstances present that clearly demonstrate that leaving the infant in the care and custody of the mother presents an imminent danger to the infant’s life or well-being. The decision to take protective custody in this situation must be determined by a complete safety assessment when there is not enough time to take the matter before the juvenile court. 2) Disabled Infants Newborn infants (not more than 28 days old) taken into protective custody, whose life or development may be threatened by a developmental disability or a handicapping condition, may need to be referred to a perinatal center for evaluation and treatment. The Child Protection Specialist shall contact the designated perinatal center in the area where the infant resides for consultation. Procedures 300, Appendix C, List of Perinatal Centers and Community Hospitals They Serve, identifies the appropriate perinatal center for each community hospital.

procedures-300_248_text,"REPORTS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT September 9, 2022 – PT 2022.07 Note: ""Developmental disability"" means intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, or other neurological handicapping conditions found to be closely related to intellectual disability, that are expected to continue indefinitely, that interrupts or delays the sequence and rate of normal growth, development and maturation, and that constitutes a substantial impairment to the individual. 3) Families Residing in Shelters A child shall not be removed from a parent or guardian living in a shelter, unless the Child Protection Specialist determines that the circumstances or conditions are such that continuing in the shelter or in the care and custody of the parent or guardian presents a real and substantial risk of harm to the child's life or health. If protective custody is ruled out, the Child Protection Specialist must determine whether the child should remain in the shelter and that an appropriate and safe sleeping arrangement is provided. 4) Domestic Violence When a child is at risk of placement because the caregiver is unable to protect the child or themselves from the violence of another person in the household, attempts must be made to prevent placement through the provision of hard services. Other alternatives for victims of domestic violence may include referrals to obtain orders of protection, exploring alternative housing with friends or relatives, requiring the violent person in the household to leave or locating and transporting the family to a domestic violence shelter. 5) Children with Special Health Care Needs When information obtained from the child’s primary care physician and other health-related resources indicate that a child with special health care needs is at substantial risk of harm and that the harm cannot be managed through a safety plan, Child Protection Specialists shall consult with their supervisors to determine if the child should be taken into protective custody. Area Administrators may waive taking the child into protective custody after reviewing all documentation and discussing the child’s health condition with the child’s primary care physician or the Department’s Regional Nurse. When protective custody is determined to be the only option to ensure the safety of a child with special health care needs, the Child Protection Specialist shall involve the DCFS Regional Nurse in the planning and preparation for safely taking the child into protective custody. When there is an urgent and immediate necessity to take a child with special health care needs into protective custody, the Child Protection Specialist shall not delay the course of action until a DCFS Regional Nurse can become involved.

Smith, Acting Director EFFECTIVE: Immediately I. PURPOSE This model Guide replaces model Guide 2008.02, Mexican Consulate Notification of Mexican or Mexican American minors in the Custody of the Department. The Memorandum of Understanding between the State of Illinois, Department of Children and Family Services and the Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago, provides for early identification of Mexican or Mexican American minors taken into protective custody by the Department. The child welfare practice issues inherent in the Memorandum of Understanding are directed toward ensuring that the needs of Mexican or Mexican American minors are met when their families are temporarily or permanently unavailable. This revised model addresses procedures that will facilitate the early coordination of legal and social services to children and their relatives that may be necessary to achieve permanency for the child, including providing the least restrictive placement and supportive services to maintain family ties, ensure appropriate visitation and maintain the child’s ethnic, religious and cultural identity. The Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Children and Family Services and the Consulate General of Mexico requires DCFS to notify the Mexican Consulate when a child is determined to be of Mexican ancestry. In order to comply with this requirement DCFS child protection and child welfare and POS workers are to notify the Office of Latino Services which is responsible for notification to the Mexican Consulate.

procedures-300_252_text,"III. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY The Consular Convention between the United States of America and the United Mexican States (Bilateral Convention) and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention) provide for consular notification and access in cases where foreign nationals are involved in legal proceedings. These treaties establish the right of representatives or agents of any embassy or consulate of a foreign government to freely communicate with, and have access to, its nationals without interference from the host state. The Department recognizes the importance of early identification of Mexican or Mexican American minors taken into protective custody in order to protect the fundamental rights of Mexican Nationals and, to the extent possible, provide all of the protections afforded to them by the Vienna Convention, the Bilateral Convention and all other applicable treaties and laws. IV. DEFINITIONS “Mexican” means any person who is a national of Mexico, regardless of immigration status in the United States. For consular notification purposes, a minor reported as born in Mexico will be assumed to be a Mexican national. “Mexican minor” means any unmarried person who is under the age of eighteen and was born in Mexico. “Mexican American minor” means any unmarried person who is under the age of eighteen, was born in the United States, and who is eligible for Mexican nationality as the biological child of at least one Mexican national. “Mexican custodian” means the non-parental caretaker of a Mexican minor, who has been entrusted by a parent(s) with the day-to-day care of the minor for any period of time. “DIF” means the Agency for Integral Family Development. This is the agency in Mexico charged with ensuring the welfare of minors. V. DETERMINATION OF MEXICAN LINEAGE Child protection workers are required to establish ancestry of every child taken into protective custody. At the beginning of an investigation, child protection workers will distribute the pamphlet CFS 1050-26, Guide for Parents who are Mexican Nationals, to all Hispanic subjects of reports. In addition, the Memorandum of Understanding between the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services and the Consulate General of Mexico requires the Department to notify the Mexican Consulate in writing within ten working days of the decision to take protective custody of a Mexican or Mexican American minor or at any time one of the following occurs: • A child for whom the Department is legally responsible (including protective custody) is identified as having Mexican ancestry. • A parent or custodian of a Mexican or Mexican American minor requests that the consulate be notified. • The Department learns that a non-custodial parent resides in Mexico.",522,https://dcfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/dcfs/documents/about-us/model-rules-and-forms/documents/procedures/procedures-300.pdf

Children who are determined to be of Mexican ancestry and who are age appropriate, and their parents or custodians shall be advised that: • They have the right to freely communicate with consular officers of their country. • The Mexican Consular Representatives may interview Mexican or Mexican American minors in the custody of the Department. • The Mexican Consulate can receive specific information, otherwise confidential regarding the reason protective custody of the Mexican minor was taken. • The Mexican Consulate can assist the Mexican child, parents or custodians in legal proceedings. VII. INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE MEXICAN CONSULATE The DCFS Office of Latino Services is responsible for the notification to the Mexican Consulate and to the Guardianship Administrator that a Mexican or Mexican American minor is in the custody/guardianship of the Department. The initial notification provided to the Mexican Consulate by the Office of Latino Services shall include the name of the minor; the minor’s date of birth, if known; the names, emails, address and telephone number of the parents or custodians, if known; the consent of the parents or custodian to the disclosure; and the name, email and telephone number of the assigned Department caseworker and the caseworker’s supervisor.

CONSULATE ACCESS TO MEXICAN OR MEXICAN AMERICAN MINORS IN THE CUSTODY OF THE DEPARTMENT Although Consular Representatives have the right to interview Mexican minors in the custody of the Department, they must first obtain the approval of the Office of the Guardianship Administrator to interview Department children in care who are of Mexican American ancestry. All interview requests must be submitted to the Guardianship Administrator or designee. IX. SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS FOR MEXICAN MINORS The Mexican Consulate will assist the Department in obtaining the necessary documentation from Mexico for Mexican minors in the Department’s custody who are eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile status. X. ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY MEXICAN CONSULATE REGARDING DIF The Mexican Consulate can assist DCFS and POS caseworkers in obtaining appropriate home studies of families in Mexico who may be resources for these Mexican minors by contacting the DIF.

The decision to open a case shall be made by the Child Protection Specialist in consultation with his or her immediate supervisor or can be court-ordered; however acceptance of services by the family is voluntary. No matter the recommended final finding of a report of abuse or neglect, if the Child Protection Specialist has identified a need for services they shall make every effort to engage the family in services appropriate for them. 1) Service Referrals When a Report has an Unfounded Recommended Finding (No Child Placed) When the Child Protection Specialist identifies a need for the family and the investigation is unfounded then the Child Protection Specialist shall consult with the Child Protection Supervisor and discuss a community service referral with the family. The family shall be informed on what service need is identified and how to access that service. Services include but are not limited to: substance abuse assessment/treatment, Family Advocacy Centers, Safe Families, mental health assessment/treatment, and domestic violence services. These referrals must be documented in a case note. The Child Protection Specialist and Child Protection Supervisor may request an Intact Family Service case opening on an unfounded investigation if the service needs are significant and cannot be met via community resources. Such requests require approval of the Area Administrator and the Statewide Intact Family Services Administrator. (See Procedures 302.388, Intact Family Services) No further action is required of the Child Protection Specialist when a child abuse or neglect report is unfounded and the family has not requested child welfare services. The hand-off document and the investigative file will be destroyed upon receipt of the notice to expunge. 2) Service Referrals When a Report has a Recommended Finding of Indicated No Child Placed) A) Opening the Service Case Child Protection Specialists are required to comprehensively discuss with the family all concerns impacting the safety and well-being of their children. The Child Protection Specialist has responsibility to discuss and offer the family intact family services if the final finding of indicated has been recommended.

B) Services Declined by the Family In the event service needs are identified and the family refuses services, the Child Protection Specialist and Child Protection Supervisor shall consult to determine whether the case should be screened with the State’s Attorney for court ordered services. If a case is screened with the State’s Attorney for court ordered services but the State’s Attorney declines to file a petition for court ordered services or consideration of a shelter care hearing, then the Child Protection Specialist and Supervisor shall consult with the DCFS Office of Legal Services. In addition, if consultation with another Department division (e.g., the Division of Clinical Practice and Development) is desired, the Child Protection Specialist and Supervisor shall make a request for such consultation thru the Area Administrator. The Area Administrator shall determine if the additional consultation is necessary. C) When an Intact Family Service Case is Already Open If there is already an open Intact Family Service case, the Child Protection Specialist shall ensure that investigative information is communicated to the assigned Intact Family Service Worker. 2) Service Referrals during a Pending Investigation Child Protection Specialists may offer services or refer the child and family for services while an investigation is still pending.
